Meri ख़ता hai ke

ANTARA
पुछदे ne mere yaar purane

Ki ho गया

Ki ho gaya

Tere nahi kyun hosh thikaane

Ki ho गया

(Kamle nu tere होर किसे di) ×2

लोड़ te fikar nahi

Ve maahi tainu khabar nahi

Tere naal tere naal
Preettaan laiyyaan

Ve maahi tainu
ख़बर nahi

Oh yeah แค่เธอโทรมาฉันก็พร้อมจะไป

Oh อย่าทำให้ฉันต้องการเลย 
Cause it’s you you you you 
Cause it’s you you you you 
 
Yeah Baby ไม่จำเป็นต้องรอ  
แค่เธอไม่ไปกับเขาก็พอ  
ให้เขารอเธออยู่ที่ห้องก็พอ 
Baby พาเธอไปที่ห้อง put your clothes on the floor 
ปล่อยความรู้สึกเธอออกมาไม่ต้องรีรอ 
ฉันอยากได้อะไรเธอไม่ต้องถามฉันหรอก 
เธอมีทุกอย่างที่ฉันต้องการ 
Pretty fashion baby ฉันว่าเธอไม่ธรรมดา

ถ้าอยากได้ gucci fendi prada & balenci  
ฉันแค่รอเธอบอก shawty tell me that you ready  
ฉันไม่ได้มาหลอก goddamn are you crazy  
ฉันแค่อยากจะกอด บอกกับเธอว่า you my baby 
 
ตาฉันมองที่ waistline  
คืนนี้ฉันไม่ waste time  
คืนนี้คงเป็น deadline  
Fuck until the Daylight

""BAM BAM"" Versuri:

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Complicat
Tu sau eu, cine-i vinovat?
Cum de-am ajuns asa?
In bucati sa-mi rupi inima

Vant si ploi
Baby nu mai vreau inapoi
Nu mai am cer senin
Doar lacrimi si venin

Pareai sincer cand minteai
Vorbe dulci cand ma iubeai
Baby boy I say bye bye

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

E tarziu si luna arde
Arde si telefonu’ aici pe podea
Amintiri ce le port
Cu mine peste tot
De ce te mai tin in brate
Cand nu mai vreau sa am sperante, nu vreau
Nici cu tine nu pot
Dar fara tine pierd tot
Stii ca
N-am vreo vina
Io, nu
Ca tu esti soare si furtuna
Doua-n una

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Vrei sa ma ai
N-ai cum
Ti-am dat iubire oricum
Oricum ai vrut
N-ai cum
Nu nu
N-ai cum n-ai cum

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Complicated
You or me, who's to blame?
How did we end up like this?
Breaking my heart into pieces
Wind and rain
Baby, I don’t want to go back anymore
I no longer have clear skies
Only tears and venom
You seemed sincere when you lied
Sweet words when you loved me
Baby boy, I say bye bye
You thought you hurt me
But you’re the one who suffered
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
I’ll be fine without you
I’m no longer the victim
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
It’s late, and the moon burns
Even the phone burns here on the floor
Memories I carry with me everywhere
Why do I still hold you in my arms
When I no longer want to have hope? I don’t
I can’t be with you
But without you, I lose everything
You know it’s not my fault
No, it’s not
That you are both sun and storm
Two in one

But you’re the one who suffered
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
I’ll be fine without you
I’m no longer the victim

You can’t
I gave you love anyway
However you wanted it
But you can’t
No, no, no
You can’t, you can’t

[Lyrics]

DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

These guys won't easily give up
You won't be able to compete with them even if you gang up
Kuwabara, Kuwabara, while I pray for safety, they move at a blinding speed
They're immortal, never silent, won't back down, pushing us with selfish greed
Get out of my way; you're in my way; I'm the other you indeed
Packed with ghosts like Sada-chan and Kaya-chan, this land of the dead is a wonderland
Sorry to interrupt your prayers, but when 4:44 rolls around
4 Japanese foot 4 Japanese sun 4 bu tall, coming at you, bang around
If you hear a voice calling, you're haunted all around

I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
The fog lifted as I crawled desperately out
When uneven elements fit well together
When the pain overlaps each other

Heart, body and mind
Overflowing somehow
If there were wings on our backs, now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
Heart, body and mind
And the nostalgic warmth
If flowers bloomed at our feet now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
I'll live again and again
Inside him, or inside you
Behind those eyelids and inside those ears
In the melody and rhythm that haunts deep down the heart for many years
DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

Again, today, in the middle of the banks of hell
Piling up the stones to the top of top
Sword fight with the demons
the lyrical chainsaw massacre
Crossing the open sea
Singin’ to myself, sha-la-la
If you need purification, bring stacks of bills till the end of time(okay?)

Someone opened the Pandora's box, I don't care about what will happen next

It's been a while; I've waited a few hundred years for this free world
Beginners and kids
Don't come this way yet, you stupid
I'm pretty sure we just made eye contact
So, this is what you wanted to show us, Shyamalan

I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
I got tired of sleeping, and there you were, waiting for me
When contradictory elements hug each other's shoulders
When the anger fades away

Heart, body and mind
Overflowing somehow
If there were feathers on our backs, now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
Heart, body and mind
And the nostalgic warmth
If flowers bloomed at our feet now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
I'll live again and again
Inside him, or inside you
Behind those eyelids and inside those ears
In the melody and rhythm that haunts deep down the heart for many years

DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

Lirik♫

Bila memang engkau tak lagi cinta
Lebih baik engkau katakan saja
Ku relakan bila kau ingin pergi
Meninggalkan luka di dalam hati

Cukup sudah kau lukai hatiku
Yang selalu tulus mencintaimu
Ku ikhlaskan semua yang terjadi
Ku akhiri cukup sampai disini

Pergilah engkau bersamanya
Anggaplah diriku yang tak pernah ada
Aku mohon jangan lukai hatinya
Cukup aku saja

Bila nanti engkau tak bahagia
Kembalilah pintu selalu terbuka
Namun hati takkan kembali
Seperti dulu lagi

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The scene begins in a warm, inviting coffee shop decorated with a festive Christmas theme. At the center of the room sits a plush red sofa set, exuding a sense of comfort and elegance. Behind the sofa stands a beautifully adorned Christmas tree, glowing with LED lights, ornaments, and a sparkling star at its peak. Next to the sofa, a crackling fireplace adds a gentle warmth, its flames dancing softly. Nearby is a charming coffee bar, complete with high stools neatly arranged. Inside the bar, a coffee machine hums as it brews fresh coffee, filling the air with an irresistible aroma. Flickering candles and steaming mugs on the countertop enhance the cozy, romantic atmosphere. Strings of LED lights draped across the ceiling bathe the entire space in a soft, magical glow.

🎄 Through the wooden fence outside, the view opens up to a serene winter night by a snow-covered lake. Flurries of snow gently fall, blanketing the surroundings in white. Across the lake, quaint wooden houses dot the landscape, their chimneys releasing trails of smoke into the cold, crisp air. The soothing sound of jazz music plays in the background, perfectly complementing the enchanting and tranquil holiday setting.

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The video begins with an exterior shot of a cozy Christmas cafe, glowing warmly against the backdrop of a snowy winter night. Gentle snowflakes fall softly, creating a serene, magical atmosphere. Inside, the smooth sounds of jazz Christmas music fill the air, perfectly complementing the inviting ambience. At the heart of the cafe is a plush red sofa set, accented with festive pillows, placed prominently in the center of the room. Across from the sofa, a traditional brick fireplace crackles with a warm, comforting glow. Beside it stands a beautifully adorned Christmas tree, sparkling with LED lights, gold and silver ornaments, and elegant garlands.

🎄 Near the fireplace, a charming wooden coffee bar features a sleek espresso machine, steaming mugs, candles, and a vase of fresh flowers. The bar is surrounded by a few high stools, offering a cozy nook for guests to enjoy their drinks. Looking from inside the cafe to the outside, the snowy outdoors comes into view—a tranquil lake reflecting the glow of small wooden cabins on the far shore, completing the picturesque winter wonderland.

(Lyrics):
[Verse 1]
Two Augusts ago
I told the truth, oh, but you didn't like it, you went home
You're in your Benz, I'm by the gate
Now you go alone
Charm all the people you train for, you mean well but aim low
And I'll make it known like I'm getting paid

[Chorus]
That's just the way life goes
I like to slam doors closed
Trust me, I know it's always about me
I love you, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Two summers from now
We'll have been talking, but not all that often, we're cool now
I'll be on a boat, you're on a plane going somewhere, same
And I'll have a drink
Wistfully lean out my window and watch the sun set on the lake
I might not feel real, but it's okay, mm

[Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way life goes
I push my luck, it shows
Thankful you don't send someone to kill me
I love you, I'm sorry

[Bridge]
You were the best but you were the worst
As sick as it sounds, I loved you first
I was a dick, it is what it is
A habit to kick, the age-old curse
I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad
I stare at the crash, it actually works
Making amends, this shit never ends
I'm wrong again, wrong again

[Chorus]
The way life goes
Joyriding down our road
Lay on the horn to prove that it haunts me
(I'm wrong again, wrong again)
I love you, I'm sorry
The way life goes
(You were the best but you were the worst)
(As sick as it sounds, I loved you first)
I wanna speak in code
(I was a dick, it is what it is)
(A habit to kick, the age-old curse)
Hope that I don't, won't make it about me
(I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad)
(I stare at the crash, it actually works)
I love you, I'm sorry

Dafina vers: 

Kur ka paranoja 
Nuk e lshoj ni zo yaya
per mu gjune gzhoja
Une si boj loja

Ski me ra, ski-ski me ra
Nese bjen aj, bi me to
Pa merak, un-jom-ajo rri  permas

Rri me to, rri - rri me to
Aj per mu osht primero
Pa merak, smunen me na ndal ata

Ti je mine yoyo
Sene tmija nuk i lo jojojoo
Jo s’tlo vet me prite
Ti e di e di

Pull me ferrari baby nuk o mercedez
Ai ma bon mu 
prit prit prit prit prit
Sun e nali jo
Prit prit prit prit prit

I pelqen shum nata, se kur del bon drit  
Duhet mi ble dhurata qe mos mu merzit
Nuk e di sa kom koh, edhe sa ki me mprit
Ka qef me ardh me mu kur dal sene me shit 

Jom tu i arrit qato qe ti kom premtu
Ty du me t bo tatu ,po nuk po kom ven ku
Me tmujt me tpa edhe kur vin mem arrestu
Edhe nese provoj mos me mujt me t'harru

Tu rreziku me ti bo qa giith ki endrru 
S'je ndiku prej fjalve qe tkan thon per mu
Ma din jeten ,tverteten n'qka kom kalu 
E kom gati bereten, tjetri me tu afru

M'ki mungu gjdo moment
Kur nuk jom kon i lir 
Shum mendime n'errsir 
I lidht me zingjir
M'ki nejt permas edhe n'diten ma tshtir
Veq me t'pa mir per kta nuk kom meshir

Nuk e di cilen deshire 
T'paren me ta kry
Kur m'thu ski me ra kurr edhe mkqyr nsy 
Nuk ka naj ligj qe un nuk muj me thy

Lyrics:
Never been easy to please
Always been best on my own
I don't need her to be kind
I get my kicks all alone
I don't do walks on the beach
I don't get dress up for a shows
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
My hearts been bruised like a peach
My souls been set like a stone
But now when Sam Cooke sings
She's got me whistling along
I didn't think I could care
But now I wait by the phone
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Mercy please
Suddenly I'm crawling to her on my knees
(Oh) Mercy please
Suddenly I need her like a harmony
Because she talks and she walks like a woman
She makes me feel like a boy when I shouldn’t
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Well now I'm eager to please
When my lady is home
I’ll give her XYZ
So I can call her my own
I used to act like a man
But what did I ever know
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Mercy please
Suddenly I'm crawling to her on my knees
(Oh) Mercy please
Suddenly I need her like a harmony
She is the subject of all my desire
Until I found her I was merely a liar
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love
