Meri ख़ता nahi

Meri ख़ता hai ke

ANTARA
पुछदे ne mere yaar purane

Ki ho गया
Ki ho gaya
Ki ho gaya

Tere nahi kyun hosh thikaane

Ki ho गया

(Kamle nu tere होर किसे di) ×2

लोड़ te fikar nahi

Ve maahi tainu khabar nahi

Tere naal tere naal
Preettaan laiyyaan

Ve maahi tainu
ख़बर nahi

Oh yeah แค่เธอโทรมาฉันก็พร้อมจะไป

Oh อย่าทำให้ฉันต้องการเลย 
Cause it’s you you you you 
Cause it’s you you you you 
 
Yeah Baby ไม่จำเป็นต้องรอ  
แค่เธอไม่ไปกับเขาก็พอ  
ให้เขารอเธออยู่ที่ห้องก็พอ 
Baby พาเธอไปที่ห้อง put your clothes on the floor 
ปล่อยความรู้สึกเธอออกมาไม่ต้องรีรอ 
ฉันอยากได้อะไรเธอไม่ต้องถามฉันหรอก 
เธอมีทุกอย่างที่ฉันต้องการ 
Pretty fashion baby ฉันว่าเธอไม่ธรรมดา

ถ้าอยากได้ gucci fendi prada & balenci  
ฉันแค่รอเธอบอก shawty tell me that you ready  
ฉันไม่ได้มาหลอก goddamn are you crazy  
ฉันแค่อยากจะกอด บอกกับเธอว่า you my baby 
 
ตาฉันมองที่ waistline  
คืนนี้ฉันไม่ waste time  
คืนนี้คงเป็น deadline  
Fuck until the Daylight 
 
Cause I like bad girls like you

""BAM BAM"" Versuri:

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Complicat
Tu sau eu, cine-i vinovat?
Cum de-am ajuns asa?
In bucati sa-mi rupi inima

Vant si ploi
Baby nu mai vreau inapoi
Nu mai am cer senin
Doar lacrimi si venin

Pareai sincer cand minteai
Vorbe dulci cand ma iubeai
Baby boy I say bye bye

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

E tarziu si luna arde
Arde si telefonu’ aici pe podea
Amintiri ce le port
Cu mine peste tot
De ce te mai tin in brate
Cand nu mai vreau sa am sperante, nu vreau
Nici cu tine nu pot
Dar fara tine pierd tot
Stii ca
N-am vreo vina
Io, nu
Ca tu esti soare si furtuna
Doua-n una

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Vrei sa ma ai
N-ai cum
Ti-am dat iubire oricum
Oricum ai vrut
N-ai cum
Nu nu
N-ai cum n-ai cum

Ai crezut ca m-ai ranit
Dar tot tu ai suferit
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam
Voi fi bine-n lipsa ta
Nu mai sunt eu victima
Bam bam bam, Bam bam bam

Complicated
You or me, who's to blame?
How did we end up like this?
Breaking my heart into pieces

I no longer have clear skies
Only tears and venom
You seemed sincere when you lied

Why do I still hold you in my arms

I can’t be with you

You know it’s not my fault
No, it’s not

[Lyrics]

DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

These guys won't easily give up
You won't be able to compete with them even if you gang up
Kuwabara, Kuwabara, while I pray for safety, they move at a blinding speed
They're immortal, never silent, won't back down, pushing us with selfish greed
Get out of my way; you're in my way; I'm the other you indeed
Packed with ghosts like Sada-chan and Kaya-chan, this land of the dead is a wonderland
Sorry to interrupt your prayers, but when 4:44 rolls around
4 Japanese foot 4 Japanese sun 4 bu tall, coming at you, bang around
If you hear a voice calling, you're haunted all around

I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
The fog lifted as I crawled desperately out
When uneven elements fit well together
When the pain overlaps each other

Heart, body and mind
Overflowing somehow
If there were wings on our backs, now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
Heart, body and mind
And the nostalgic warmth
If flowers bloomed at our feet now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
I'll live again and again
Inside him, or inside you
Behind those eyelids and inside those ears
In the melody and rhythm that haunts deep down the heart for many years
DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

Again, today, in the middle of the banks of hell
Piling up the stones to the top of top
Sword fight with the demons
the lyrical chainsaw massacre
Crossing the open sea
Singin’ to myself, sha-la-la
If you need purification, bring stacks of bills till the end of time(okay?)

Someone opened the Pandora's box, I don't care about what will happen next

It's been a while; I've waited a few hundred years for this free world
Beginners and kids
Don't come this way yet, you stupid
I'm pretty sure we just made eye contact
So, this is what you wanted to show us, Shyamalan

I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside, I'm inside
I got tired of sleeping, and there you were, waiting for me
When contradictory elements hug each other's shoulders
When the anger fades away

Heart, body and mind
Overflowing somehow
If there were feathers on our backs, now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
Heart, body and mind
And the nostalgic warmth
If flowers bloomed at our feet now
I'll say goodbye to darkness anyhow
Far away, we'll fly away
I'll live again and again
Inside him, or inside you
Behind those eyelids and inside those ears
In the melody and rhythm that haunts deep down the heart for many years

DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN DAN DADAN...

Lirik♫

Bila memang engkau tak lagi cinta
Lebih baik engkau katakan saja
Ku relakan bila kau ingin pergi
Meninggalkan luka di dalam hati

Cukup sudah kau lukai hatiku
Yang selalu tulus mencintaimu
Ku ikhlaskan semua yang terjadi
Ku akhiri cukup sampai disini

Pergilah engkau bersamanya
Anggaplah diriku yang tak pernah ada
Aku mohon jangan lukai hatinya
Cukup aku saja

Bila nanti engkau tak bahagia
Kembalilah pintu selalu terbuka
Namun hati takkan kembali
Seperti dulu lagi

(Lyrics):
[Verse 1]
Two Augusts ago
I told the truth, oh, but you didn't like it, you went home
You're in your Benz, I'm by the gate
Now you go alone
Charm all the people you train for, you mean well but aim low
And I'll make it known like I'm getting paid

[Chorus]
That's just the way life goes
I like to slam doors closed
Trust me, I know it's always about me
I love you, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
Two summers from now
We'll have been talking, but not all that often, we're cool now
I'll be on a boat, you're on a plane going somewhere, same
And I'll have a drink
Wistfully lean out my window and watch the sun set on the lake
I might not feel real, but it's okay, mm

[Chorus]
'Cause that's just the way life goes
I push my luck, it shows
Thankful you don't send someone to kill me
I love you, I'm sorry

[Bridge]
You were the best but you were the worst
As sick as it sounds, I loved you first
I was a dick, it is what it is
A habit to kick, the age-old curse
I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad
I stare at the crash, it actually works
Making amends, this shit never ends
I'm wrong again, wrong again

[Chorus]
The way life goes
Joyriding down our road
Lay on the horn to prove that it haunts me
(I'm wrong again, wrong again)
I love you, I'm sorry
The way life goes
(You were the best but you were the worst)
(As sick as it sounds, I loved you first)
I wanna speak in code
(I was a dick, it is what it is)
(A habit to kick, the age-old curse)
Hope that I don't, won't make it about me
(I tend to laugh whenever I'm sad)
(I stare at the crash, it actually works)
I love you, I'm sorry

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The scene begins in a warm, inviting coffee shop decorated with a festive Christmas theme. At the center of the room sits a plush red sofa set, exuding a sense of comfort and elegance. Behind the sofa stands a beautifully adorned Christmas tree, glowing with LED lights, ornaments, and a sparkling star at its peak. Next to the sofa, a crackling fireplace adds a gentle warmth, its flames dancing softly. Nearby is a charming coffee bar, complete with high stools neatly arranged. Inside the bar, a coffee machine hums as it brews fresh coffee, filling the air with an irresistible aroma. Flickering candles and steaming mugs on the countertop enhance the cozy, romantic atmosphere. Strings of LED lights draped across the ceiling bathe the entire space in a soft, magical glow.

🎄 Through the wooden fence outside, the view opens up to a serene winter night by a snow-covered lake. Flurries of snow gently fall, blanketing the surroundings in white. Across the lake, quaint wooden houses dot the landscape, their chimneys releasing trails of smoke into the cold, crisp air. The soothing sound of jazz music plays in the background, perfectly complementing the enchanting and tranquil holiday setting.

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The video begins with an exterior shot of a cozy Christmas cafe, glowing warmly against the backdrop of a snowy winter night. Gentle snowflakes fall softly, creating a serene, magical atmosphere. Inside, the smooth sounds of jazz Christmas music fill the air, perfectly complementing the inviting ambience. At the heart of the cafe is a plush red sofa set, accented with festive pillows, placed prominently in the center of the room. Across from the sofa, a traditional brick fireplace crackles with a warm, comforting glow. Beside it stands a beautifully adorned Christmas tree, sparkling with LED lights, gold and silver ornaments, and elegant garlands.

🎄 Near the fireplace, a charming wooden coffee bar features a sleek espresso machine, steaming mugs, candles, and a vase of fresh flowers. The bar is surrounded by a few high stools, offering a cozy nook for guests to enjoy their drinks. Looking from inside the cafe to the outside, the snowy outdoors comes into view—a tranquil lake reflecting the glow of small wooden cabins on the far shore, completing the picturesque winter wonderland.

💌 Hope you all will contribute ideas to help my channel grow more and more. That's also my motivation to make the next videos better

Pull me ferrari baby nuk o mercedez
Ai ma bon mu 
prit prit prit prit prit
Sun e nali jo
Prit prit prit prit prit

Dafina vers: 

Kur ka paranoja 
Nuk e lshoj ni zo yaya
per mu gjune gzhoja
Une si boj loja

Ski me ra, ski-ski me ra
Nese bjen aj, bi me to
Pa merak, un-jom-ajo rri  permas

Rri me to, rri - rri me to
Aj per mu osht primero
Pa merak, smunen me na ndal ata

Ti je mine yoyo
Sene tmija nuk i lo jojojoo
Jo s’tlo vet me prite
Ti e di e di
Qe un vi…

Pull me ferrari baby nuk o mercedez
Ai ma bon mu 
prit prit prit prit prit
Sun e nali jo
Prit prit prit prit prit

I pelqen shum nata, se kur del bon drit  
Duhet mi ble dhurata qe mos mu merzit
Nuk e di sa kom koh, edhe sa ki me mprit
Ka qef me ardh me mu kur dal sene me shit 

Jom tu i arrit qato qe ti kom premtu
Ty du me t bo tatu ,po nuk po kom ven ku
Me tmujt me tpa edhe kur vin mem arrestu
Edhe nese provoj mos me mujt me t'harru

Tu rreziku me ti bo qa giith ki endrru 
S'je ndiku prej fjalve qe tkan thon per mu
Ma din jeten ,tverteten n'qka kom kalu 
E kom gati bereten, tjetri me tu afru

M'ki mungu gjdo moment
Kur nuk jom kon i lir 
Shum mendime n'errsir 
I lidht me zingjir
M'ki nejt permas edhe n'diten ma tshtir
Veq me t'pa mir per kta nuk kom meshir

Nuk e di cilen deshire 
T'paren me ta kry
Kur m'thu ski me ra kurr edhe mkqyr nsy 
Nuk ka naj ligj qe un nuk muj me thy
Tregom kush tka zhgenjy

Lyrics:
Never been easy to please
Always been best on my own
I don't need her to be kind
I get my kicks all alone
I don't do walks on the beach
I don't get dress up for a shows
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
My hearts been bruised like a peach
My souls been set like a stone
But now when Sam Cooke sings
She's got me whistling along
I didn't think I could care
But now I wait by the phone
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Mercy please
Suddenly I'm crawling to her on my knees
(Oh) Mercy please
Suddenly I need her like a harmony
Because she talks and she walks like a woman
She makes me feel like a boy when I shouldn’t
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Well now I'm eager to please
When my lady is home
I’ll give her XYZ
So I can call her my own
I used to act like a man
But what did I ever know
She got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Mercy please
Suddenly I'm crawling to her on my knees
(Oh) Mercy please
Suddenly I need her like a harmony
She is the subject of all my desire
Until I found her I was merely a liar
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love
Oh she got me good
I feel like a boy in love

Bask in these exquisite melodies meticulously crafted to quiet the relentless churn of anxious thoughts. As delicate piano notes shimmer like light dancing on still waters, feel the frantic momentum within begin to slow. Soothing strings and ethereal vocals envelop you in warmth, coaxing pent-up tension to dissipate with each lingering refrain. Allow the gentle cadences to guide your breath into its natural rhythm as racing heartbeats gradually return to a state of ease. Whether you seek respite from overthinking's grip, a reprieve from unrelenting stressors, or a nudge across the threshold into deep restorative sleep - these are the harmonies that hold the healing balm. Drift into their tender embrace and let go of relentless mental chatter, letting wave after soothing wave roll worries and wakefulness away until only profound peacefulness remains.

Music to sleep deeply and rest the mind, relaxing and calm music to sleep.
To stay calm and relieve stress after a hard day at work, turn on soothing music. By listening to relaxing music, you can reduce stress hormones in the body. It helps the body fight the symptoms of prolonged stress.
We are a music label that does everything possible to help you feel calmer and happier with music. Music has no barriers, so no matter who you are or where you come from, these beautiful beats are made for you. Join the journey to find your inner peace and brighten your day.

〈小林光大監督 コメント〉
踊り子という素晴らしい楽曲はどの時代も揺るがない音楽の営みをあらためて実感させてくれました。この詩から感じられる反骨、強いまなざしを当代のミューズが歌います。

〈小松菜奈さん コメント〉
Vaundyさんにとっても''特別な楽曲''と仰っていましたが、
そんな大切な曲のMVに参加させていただく事ができてとっても嬉しいです。
撮影の日は一日中、「踊り子」が頭の中で何回も何回も回り続け、私もくるくる・ぴょんぴょん・るんるんと。
ずっと踊っていられる、踊りたくなる曲、
自由に身体を揺らしながらあっという間に一日が過ぎ、幸せな時間を過ごさせてもらいました！
そしてVaundyさんご本人が自らメイキングを回してる姿にびっくりしたのと同時に、
一つ一つに丁寧な方なんだなと思いました。
一緒に楽しんでくれるVaundyさんが現場に居る事で、和やかでhappyな撮影になりました。
私にとっても大好きな曲になりました。
是非MVを最後までお楽しみください！

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The video opens with a cozy coffee shop ambience in the heart of winter, exuding warmth amidst the cold season. At the center of the space is a wooden table and chairs placed on the floor, bathed in the soft glow of warm lights. Beside the seating area, a crackling fireplace radiates gentle heat, adding a sense of comfort and intimacy to the ambience. Opposite the table is a small bar counter adorned with neatly arranged stools. Behind the counter, the soft hum of a coffee machine fills the air, accompanied by the clinking of ceramic coffee mugs and the sight of a delicate flower vase, lending a fresh and inviting charm to the interior.

⛄ Beyond the indoor space, a wooden fence frames a serene view of a snowy lakeside landscape. Snowflakes gently fall, blanketing the ground and the wooden houses scattered across the far side of the lake. The soothing sound of Jazz Piano fills the air, perfectly blending with the tranquil and warm atmosphere of this winter retreat.

💌 Hope you all will contribute ideas to help my channel grow more and more. That's also my motivation to make the next videos better

“I thought im the most troublesome,
 but this guy is on another level”
Friends,relatives and the neighbors 
they say, “What on earth is this guy doing?""
no matter how much they curse and spread rumours
If they say you’re being dope,
isn’t that really dope?
I know why they talk like that,
because everything doesn’t always go as planned.
Whatever happens, have the courage to say`tha pathukalam’,
Feeling sad about what’s already gone is a time waste.
“Stand tall before a society that stabs you when you're down""
said poet’u Dhanush the great!
but people keep spreading hate illogically.
If so, am i the next Andrew Tate?
Spreading hate online is the new internet culture?
Honestly, prostitution would be a better hobby!
 Even if a thousand people hide it with dirty hands
The sun will still rise after settling down in the evening.
Hey, Do you even know where this guy comes from?
You talk like you know something, don’t say a word.
 Oh man, he’s such a notorious guy, isn’t he?
That’s no one else—it’s me, I'm that guy!
Who’s that guy? 
I’m that guy!
Who’s that guy? 
I’m that guy!
Who’s that guy? 
I’m that guy!
Who’s that guy? 
I’m that guy!
Is this all lyrics?
was these written by Asal Kolaar?
he is not Asal Kolaar,
 he is complete Kolaar!
“Y’all will see one day”
At five, they gave me beatings 
and made me realize that crying is a waste
which is how I became strong.. 
Uncomfortable situations will shape your maturity -
and wisdom,
am i right ?
Even from stealing, you learn tricks and strategies,
but there’s so much more to experience in life.
Few backstab you to get bigger,
 few get stomach burn from those who are already bigger.
Should i bring a fire engine?!
don’t hide and see
 Like a fake ID ""Sivaranjini underscore 15"".
to those who give illegal entry
and cause problems,
Ill attack and chase them out 
like Donald Trump!
`Asal Kolaar -
Chikkom 
Yelra
Teasta’
If I get bored,
I’ll go around in my dad’s boat along the coast.
 Even if I go to Kuala Lumpur,
 I’ll still speak thandaiyarpetta slang.
 I’ll eat local food there, like dosa, and also some h*es.
You file a CBI complaint?
 I’ll drain your UPI account.
If you comment in URL,
ill break your face in IRL.
Hey, Do you even know where this guy comes from?

🎤 Lyrics: Craig David - Insomnia

[Intro]
Jim Beanz, give it to me, oh baby I can't!

[Verse 1]
Never thought that I'd fall in love, love, love, love
But it grew from a simple crush, crush, crush, crush
Being without you girl, I was all messed up, up, up, up
When you walked out, said that you'd had enough-nough-nough

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a fool, girl, I know
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time, you'll change your mind
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

[Chorus]
Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

[Verse 2]
Remember telling my boys that I'd never fall in love, love, love, love
You used to think I'd never find a girl I could trust, trust, trust, trust
And then you walked into my life and it was all about us, us, us, us
But now, I'm sitting here, thinking I messed the whole thing up, up, up, up

[Pre-Chorus]
Been a fool (fool), girl, I know (know)
Didn't expect this is how things would go
Maybe in time (time), you'll change your mind (mind)
Now looking back, I wish I could rewind

[Chorus]
Because I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (to me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Because it feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ah, I just can't go to sleep
'Cause it feels like I've fallen for you
It's getting way too deep
And I know that it's love because
[Chorus]
I can't sleep 'til you're next to me
No, I can't live without you no more (without you no more)
Oh, I stay up 'til you're next to me (to me)
'Til this house feels like it did before

[Post-Chorus]
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah
Feels like insomnia, ah-ah-ah

ENGLISH LYRICS: 
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide

No one could hear me, I was singing secretly to myself
But now I step forward without fear, I feel
Better, confident, I’m feeling good about myself
I felt lost but the music got me

Screaming from the rooftop
Come on, shout it out
Everybody sing it out loud

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide
In harmony, together we unite
Oh oh oh
Together until the end
We’ll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, shout it out
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Till the end of time

But what if it gets silent
A world without sound
No one listens to each other's stories anymore
So don’t turn down the lights, come sing along

Let's sing in harmony
And join us in the symphony
Everyone understands the language of music

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide
In harmony
Together we unite
Oh oh oh
Together until the end

We’ll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, SHOUT IT OUT
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Till the end of time

The music got me like
Oh oh sing
Oh oh
Like oh oh sing
Oh oh sing
Oh oh
Like oh oh sing
Oh oh sing
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide

Lyrics of Chikni Chameli - चिकनी चमेली
bicchu mere naina, badi zeherili ankkh maare
kamsin kamriya saali ik thumke se lakh maare
haye bicchu mere naina, badi zeherili ankkh maare
kamsin kamriya saali ik thumke se lakh maare
note hazaaro ke khulla chhutta karaane aayi
husn ki teeli se beedi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

jungle me aaj mangal karungi bhukhe shero se khelugi main
makkhan jaisi hatheli pe jalte angaare le lungi main
haye gehre paani ki machhli hu raja
ghsat ghsat dariya me ghumi hu main
teri nazron ki lehero se haar ke aaj dubi hu mai
hoye jaanleva jalwa hai, dekhne me halwa hai
jaanleva jalwa hai, hai dekhne me halwa hai
pyaar se paros doongi toot le zara
ye to trailer hai, puri film dikhaane aayi
husn ki teeli se bidi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

banjar basti me aayi hai masti aisa namkin chehra tera
meri niyat pe chad gaya chhute na hai rang gehra tera
joban ye mera khenchi hai raja saare pardo ko katungi main
shaame meri akeli hai aaja sang tere baatungi main
haye baato me ishaara hai, jisme khel saara hai
baato me ishara hai jisme khel saara hai
tod ke tijoriyo ko loot le zara
choom ke zakhmo pe thoda malham lagaane aayi
husn ki teeli se beedi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni aayi, aayi chikni aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

Lyrics:
Terdiam di tatapanmu
Menghantui pikiranku,
terus menerus
Tak lupa hangat senyummu
Hiasi gelap malamku

Kau datang tak ku duga
Beri aku tawa
Bahagia hariku,
kau buat sempurna
Mungkin kita bisa berjalan bersama
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Serasa kuingin katakan pada dunia
Seberapa ku inginkanmu,
temani hidupku yang dulu kelam
Kau jadikan penuh makna
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Banyak harapku untukmu
Di dalam tidurku dan bangunku

Kau datang tak ku duga
Beri aku tawa
Bahagia hariku,
kau buat sempurna
Mungkin kita bisa berjalan bersama
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Serasa kuingin katakan pada dunia
Seberapa ku inginkanmu,
temani hidupku yang dulu kelam
Kau jadikan penuh makna
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Kan tiba waktunya
Tuk ungkapkan semua (kepadamu)

Serasa kuingin katakan pada dunia
Seberapa ku inginkanmu,
temani hidupku yang dulu kelam
Kau jadikan penuh makna
Tunggu sejenak ini belum saat nya

Tunggu apa lagi
Ini lah saat nya

Haunting my mind,
continuously
Not forgetting your warm smile
Decorating my dark nights
You came unexpectedly
Gave me laughter
Made my day happy,
you made it perfect
Maybe we could walk together
Wait a moment, it's not the time yet
I feel like telling the world
How much I want you,
to accompany my once-dark life
You've filled it with meaning
Wait a moment, it's not the time yet
I have many hopes for you
In my sleep and in my waking
You came unexpectedly
Gave me laughter
Made my day happy,
you made it perfect
Maybe we could walk together
Wait a moment, it's not the time yet

Lyrisc;
Çık çık saklasaydın, bana öyle bakmasaydın
Keşke tanımasaydım, tanıdığım gibi kalsaydın nolurdu?
Koş, kaçtın işte. Bitti gitti yalan gülüşle
Son bulur aşk, yine yansın her şey yak!

Çık çık saklasaydın, bana öyle bakmasaydın
Keşke tanımasaydım, tanıdığım gibi kalsaydın nolurdu?
Koş, kaçtın işte. Bitti gitti yalan gülüşle
Son bulur aşk, yine yansın her şey yak!

İki kadeh şarap olsak
Birbirimize bakıp da sarhoş olsak
Artık değilim sana tutsak
Ya da kopamam belki de asla

Gelmem asla
Artık resmini duvarlarıma asmam
Karıştı rüyalar, boynumda günahlar
Sırtımda hançerle kazılı bütün yalanlar

Sırtıma hançeri bin kez vur
Yeter ki şu yüzüme bir kez gül
Yazar mı yine bana bir mektup?
Yeterdi bi kez onu hissetsem

Hayır hissetmem
Kendimi tanımıyorum bazen
Eğer bi gün geri dönersen
Bi daha beyaz sayfaları pisletmem

Artık kalbimden

Çık çık saklasaydın, bana öyle bakmasaydın
Keşke tanımasaydım, tanıdığım gibi kalsaydın nolurdu?
Koş, kaçtın işte. Bitti gitti yalan gülüşle
Son bulur aşk, yine yansın her şey yak!

Çık çık saklasaydın, bana öyle bakmasaydın
Keşke tanımasaydım, tanıdığım gibi kalsaydın nolurdu?
Koş, kaçtın işte. Bitti gitti yalan gülüşle
Son bulur aşk, yine yansın her şey yak!

Neden inandım kaldım bu çukurda hep
Tüm içimdekileri dökene dek
Var mıydı sence başka seçeneğim
Bi gün öleceğim seni düşünerek

Üzülme hiç gülümse

Lagu ini merupakan curahan hati Leika yang merasakan hangatnya persahabatan. Leika berharap, persahabatan ini akan menjadi sebuah perjalanan yang terus ada hingga mereka dewasa. Lirik dan nada dasar lagu ini diciptakan oleh Leika dengan beberapa bantuan dari sang Ayah (Ilman Hidayat), Bunda (Diena Fitri), Om Saka, dan Om Wisnu dalam pengolahannya. Leika berharap lagu ini tidak hanya menjadi pengingat #sahabat untuk teman seusianya saja, namun juga orang dewasa yang merindukan kehadiran #sahabat.

ENGLISH LYRICS: 
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide

No one could hear me, I was singing secretly to myself
But now I step forward without fear, I feel
Better, confident, I’m feeling good about myself
I felt lost but the music got me

Screaming from the rooftop
Come on, shout it out
Everybody sing it out loud

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide
In harmony, together we unite
Oh oh oh
Together until the end
We’ll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, shout it out
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Till the end of time

But what if it gets silent
A world without sound
No one listens to each other's stories anymore
So don’t turn down the lights, come sing along

Let's sing in harmony
And join us in the symphony
Everyone understands the language of music

All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide
In harmony
Together we unite
Oh oh oh
Together until the end

We’ll go beyond the stars, our light shining forever
Screaming from the rooftop, SHOUT IT OUT
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Till the end of time

The music got me like
Oh oh sing
Oh oh
Like oh oh sing
Oh oh sing
Oh oh
Like oh oh sing
Oh oh sing
All we need is music in our lives
Oh oh oh
Sing it worldwide

He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's chokin', how? Everybody's jokin' now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow
Snap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity
Ope, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad
But he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it
He knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter
He's dope

LYRICS

Me a date two people at the same time
Just weighing my options
Playing two sides of the same coin
Might end up inna some problems
But
A nuh cheat me a cheat just a date by law
And if me give it up me not doing it raw
If you try fi stop me from do what I want
Me and you nuh deh mi love, you can’t give me no talk
Just a be myself, mi just a play my part
If you fall in love then that a your fault
Mi know that it might sound crazy
But till me pick you, you have to share, me share me

You a nuh mi man
Me nafi explain
Mi nuh have no obligation
Journey might be slow
But me have to sure say you're the one
So me have couple a unu in a rotation
All mi needs them haffi met
Can you cut the check?
If you the best candidate
Then you get elect
And if you wah go
Baby you can go
And me wouldn’t blame you
Because me never claim you
Have two people a ring my phone line
And a ask ""when we a go spend time?""
Me a play two sides at the same
Me just a mingle baby cuz me outside

Seeing two people at the same time
Just weighing my options
Playing two sides of the same coin
Might end up inna some problems
But
A nuh cheat me a cheat just a date by law
And if me give it up me not doing it raw
If you try fi stop me from do what I want
Me and you nuh deh mi love, you can’t give me no talk
Just a be myself, mi just a play my part
If you fall in love then that a your fault
Mi know say it might sound crazy
But till me pick you, you have to share, me share me

This a just the warm-up
You either compete or give it all up
Me nuh promiscuous just nah get stuck
This ya gyal ya head smart she nuh get caught up too quick
Take me time nah rush
Nuh tek me go a court, hope seh you don’t judge
No boy alive can’t pass up
So till the day my mind made up
I’ll date...

Two people at the same time
Gotta weigh my options
Playing both sides of the same coin
Might end up inna some problems
But
A nuh cheat me a cheat just a date by law
And if me give it up me not doing it raw
If you try fi stop me from do what I want
Me and you nuh deh mi love, you can’t give me no talk
Just a be myself, mi just a play my part
If you fall in love then that a your fault
Mi know say it might sound crazy
But me pick you, you have to share, me share

Ahhh
Ahhhhhhh
Me na commit no crime
Anu treason
A just Dating Season

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Hlg_PqaVuE,Zivilia - Gunung Sindur Jangan Goyang (Official Music Video),"Zivilia Band kembali merilis sebuah lagu baru yang berjudul ""Gunung Sindur Jangan Goyang"". Lagu ini menceritakan kisah kehidupan seorang warga binaan lembaga pemasyarakatan yang menjalani hukumannya, namun tidak pernah kehilangan semangat untuk terus berkarya.

Dengan lirik yang mendalam dan melodi dan beat yang mengajak untuk bergoyang, lagu ini menggambarkan perjalanan emosional seorang individu yang terkurung dalam penjara, namun tetap berjuang untuk menemukan makna hidup melalui karya seni. Lagu ini menjadi bukti bahwa semangat berkarya dan harapan tidak terhalang oleh dinding-dinding penjara,ataupun kendala yang menyertainya.

Lagu ini berangkat dari ide dari Bapak Rangga Permata yang menjabat sebagai Kasi Binadik Lapas Khusus Klas IIA Gunung Sindur dan dikembangkan secara musikal oleh Zivilia Band dan Team Zivilia. dengan harapan bersama dengan karya ini menjadi pelecut semangat untuk semua warga binaan dalam Lapas Khusus Klas IIA Gunung sindur khususnya dan seluruh pendengar pada umumnya untuk selalu semangat dan jangan goyang seberat apapun rintangan dan masalah yang terjadi bahkan ketika harus menjalani hukuman karena melakukan kekhilafan.

Peluncuran lagu ini diharapkan dapat menginspirasi banyak orang, mengingatkan kita akan pentingnya kesempatan kedua dan kekuatan untuk bangkit meski menghadapi tantangan besar. Zivilia Band berharap lagu ini dapat menyentuh hati pendengar dan memberi pesan positif tentang ketahanan dan semangat untuk terus berkarya, apapun keadaan yang dihadapi.

TANDANG MAKALANGAN!

lirik :

(Verse1) 
Setahun sudah ku jalani..
Di balik tembok gunung sindur.. 
Karena Narkoba hidupku jadi begini.. 

(Verse 2) 
Sudah tiga bulan lebih.. 
Kekasih hati tak datang.. 
besukan dan tak lagi pernah ada kabarnya.. 

(Pre-Chorus) 
Terkurung dalam bui, ditinggalkan kekasih.. 
Jangan kau tangisi.. 
Mending kita bernyanyi untuk menghibur diri.. 
Obat patah hati.. 

Ku sidang pulang pergi.. 
naik mobil tahanan.. 
Badan sakit-sakit.. 
Tuntutan seumur hidup.. 
Putus 18 tahun, Alhamdulillah.. 

(Reff/Chorus) 
Gunung sindur.. 
Jangan goyang.. 
Gunung sindur.. 
Jangan goyang.. 

(Verse 3) 
Inilah kisah hidupku.. 
Di balik tembok gunung sindur.. 
Di sini ku temukan hikmah dan pelajaran..

Weapon Lyrics :

Sun Mere Baap Ka Se Bada Karobaar
Vo to 40 50 Bande Rakhe Se Staff Me
Sallery Ke Cheque Makha Bhot Mote Jave
Pure Mahine Ka Hisab Pade 18 20 Lakh Me
Tere Papa Ne Dikha Diye Re Photo Meri Jaan
Nu to Dekhle Jamai Tera Gang Rakhe Se
Tham Bolo So Staff Hum Bhai Bolya Kare
Bina Salary Ye Sheher Sara Hang Rakhe Se
Kaam Ke Batau Thara Gaam Ke Batau
Kaam Ke Batau Thara Gaam Ke Batau
Bapu Nat Jaga Doge Aur Goli Dekh Ke
Bapu Nat Jaga Doge Aur Goli Dekh Ke
Kaam Ka Andaja Nu Keh Weapona Te Laale
Aur Gaam Ka Andaja Laale Tauli Dekh Ke
Hoor Ki Pari Se Nu to Duniya Mein Bhot
Hoi Tere Te Attachment Bholi Dekh Ke
Kaam Ka Andaja Nu Keh Weapona Te Laale
Aur Gaam Ka Andaja Laale Tauli Dekh Ke

Chandi Aali Dabbi Mein Ke Rakhe Se Tu Kd Re
Yo Kala Tarkol Sa Jo Khaye Jave Se
Ise Ne Bana Rakhi Se Aankh Meri Laal
Tere Naam Ka Suroor Ya Chadhaye Jave Se
Dadi Pucche Kaamkaj Saare Khul Jange Raj
Dadi Pucche Kaamkaj Saare Khul Jange Raj
Re Ye Chadhi Teri Aankh Oli Soli Dekh Ke
Re Ye Chadhi Teri Aankh Oli Soli Dekh Ke
Kaam Ka Andaja Nu Keh Weapona Te Laale
Aur Gaam Ka Andaja Laale Tauli Dekh Ke
Hoor Ki Pari Se Nu to Duniya Mein Bhot
Hoi Tere Te Attachment Bholi Dekh Ke
Kaam Ka Andaja Nu Keh Weapona Te Laale
Aur Gaam Ka Andaja Laale Tauli Dekh Ke

Tere Aage Chaand Aur Tare
Fike Sare Ke Sare Aapa Na Hove Nyare
Haye Re Mere Shakkar Pare
Manne Tu Cute Si Lage Ragni Duet Si Lage
Kalli Tu Lage Sachhi Baki Sab Jhuth Si Lage
Tu Lage Phoola Bargi Saman Ke Jhula Bargi
Suit Mein Tati Lage Maati Ke Chulha Bargi
Katil Tera Kala Til Se Feelling Sari Fulfill Se
Ve Akshar 3 Bolde Jinki Re Baat Mein Dil Se

Meri Family Ne Chahiye Re Clean Shave Banda
Tu to Dhadhi Nhi Katanda Jama Daaku Lage Se
Hore Hatha Pe Bhi Hokke Ke Nishan Meri Jaan
Makha Dhai Teen Lakh Ka Tambakhoo Lage Se
Tera Deu Ke Parichay Lage Khakhi Aale Pichhe
Tera Deu Ke Parichay Lage Khakhi Aale Pichhe
Mummy Dar Jagi Pcr Dholi Dekh Ke
Mummy Dar Jagi Pcr Dholi Dekh Ke
Kaam Ka Andaja Nu Keh Weapona Te Laale
Aur Gaam Ka Andaja Laale Tauli Dekh Ke
Rangne Se Gaal Tere Lana Se Gulaal

Lyrics:

Yeh Bhi Na Jaane
Woh Bhi Na Jaane
Naino Ke Rang Naina Jaane
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Jag Ki Koi Reet Na Jaane
Main Toh Bas Teri Hui Deewani
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Teri Hi Baatein Ho
Subah Si Raatein Ho
Jab Se Mila Hai Tu
Dil Ko Mila Sukoon
Tu Hi Raah Meri, Tu Hi Safar Hai
Teri Baahon Mein, Ab Mera Ghar Hai

Chain Na Jaane Dard Na Jaane
Dil Toh Bas Dil Ko Pehchaane
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera

The largest grand prize
in entertainment history,
and competing for this $5,000,000
are these 1000 contestants!
-[cheers]
-Come on in!
[MrBeast]
What you are witnessing is real.
A record breaking number
of a thousand players
is currently stampeding this arena.
But only one
of these thousand people you are seeing
will have what it takes
to beat everyone around them
and take home this generational wealth
of $5,000,000 dollars.
-Welcome to Beast Games!
-[cheering]
[woman] I grew up homeless, and now,
I want to help other homeless kids.
And that $5,000,000 would mean everything
to help me get there.
[man] If I win $5,000,000,
I could use that to make passive income
for the rest of my life.
It would provide me the opportunity
to retire my dad.
The difference that money can make
and how it can support community.
Completely getting my whole family
out of the poverty pipeline.
There's a lot of clowns
that want to donate the money.
I'm buying jet skis and gold chains.
I will die for this.
I will die for $5,000,000.
[MrBeast] This is gonna be crazy.
Everyone’s so excited.
Good luck, man!
This show is bigger
than anything you could ever imagine.
We’ve got the most players,
millions of dollars of cash prizes,
on top of the $5,000,000.
We're giving away a Lamborghini
and a multi-million dollar island.
We even built an entire city.
I'm MrBeast, these are my five friends,
and what what you're about
to see will blow your mind!
Before the games begin,
I have an offer for all of you.
Most shows have a grand prize
of $1,000,000.
But on our show, we're going
to give away $1,000,000
before we even play the first game.
-[cheering]
-Bring out $1,000,000!
[dramatic music playing]
[register dings]
It's going to take a second.
$1,000,000 is a lot of money.
There's currently $1,000,000 in cash
sitting in front of me.
Throw ten minutes on the clock.
You will have this ten minutes
to make a decision.
Stay in the game, or press the button
on your tablet and eliminate yourself.
-[groans]
-Those of you that eliminate yourselves
will evenly split this $1,000,000
I'm standing behind.
So if only one of you eliminates yourself,
you'll become a millionaire.
But if 50 of you eliminate yourselves,
you'll each get $20,000.
So be honest,
do you really think that you are
that one in 1000 player,
the rightful champion winner
of that $5,000,000?
Or do you want to take the easy way out
and walk away with money
while you still can?
Start the timer.
[overlapping chatter]
What will my family think?
If I say “no” to so much money?
Take the deal. Take the deal.
Yeah. I mean… It’s a lot of money…
I will not leave this podium.
I will not go home
until that $5,000,000 is mine.
-[chatter continues]
-[boom]
[MrBeast] Oh, we got one!
[woman] Oh, my God! He did it!
We got our first taker!
Steve!
As of right now, you're a millionaire.
-But, oh! Someone else hit it!
-[boom]
Alright, now you’re only
a five-hundred thousandaire.
-[beeps]
-[booms continue]
[man] That’s crazy though, bro, because
imagine you're walking into a casino,
you would never get that
in a million years…
[MrBeast] We are halfway through the time!
Right now, if you press the button,
-that's $250,000.
-Heck, no.
You're not gonna leave for $200,000?
-No, I’m not--
-$200,000?
I’m not leaving.
It’s just not worth it now.
I mean, I--
I'm not taking the bribe. No chance.
I'm here for the long haul till the end.
-[yells]
-Do you think I'm gonna take the deal?
-No.
-No way, Jimmy. No way.
This dude's crazy.
You're pressing it?
You're pressing it? Why not?
It's getting a lot of people out
right away,
and that's less people
we have to compete against.
-This is too intense, man!
-We're staying!
-Are you sure?
-Yes!
-[man] I don't know!
-Think about it! There’s two minutes left!
Oh, there goes another one!
I ain't taking nothin’!
[MrBeast] Bro, 90 grand’s a lot!
That's cute compared
to the $5,000,000 that's over here.
Under one minute remains.
[dramatic music continues]
-Don't you dare.
-[laughs]
[laughing] Get out of here!
[intensifying noises]
-[clicks]
-[booms]
I should not have done that.
I should not have done that.
-Ten seconds!
-You should press it now!
-[MrBeast] Hey, y’all are crazy!
-[yellling]
Ah, come on, buddy!
Hit it! Hit the button!
-No way!
-[cheers]
Are you serious? No way.
[MrBeast] In the end,
the total amount of button presses
was 52 people which means…
Congratulations! You each
just won a little under $20,000!
-[cheering]
-All 52 of you are now eliminated.
I have a feeling
a lot of these contestants still in
are gonna regret not taking that money,
because this next game might be
the most cutthroat thing I've ever done.
Should’ve took the money.
Would this money change my life?
Absolutely.
Do I want to see a pirate ship?
Do I want to live in a city? So much more.

I do not belong here.
I don't know how I made it here.
I have no strategy. [laughs] I'm done.
[MrBeast]
To the 948 of you that rejected my offer,
there is no turning back!
The Beast Games has now begun.
[cheering]
[dramatic music intensifies]
And for the first game,
you will all be competing as teams.
This row is a team.
This row is a team. This row is a team.
You get the point. Each massive row
of 80 players will be working together.
-[cheers]
-Yeah, but I wouldn't cheer quite yet,
and that's because in order
for your team to move on,
someone must sacrifice themselves.
-Oh!
-[MrBeast] Meaning that they will have to,
at their own will,
walk away from $5,000,000,
just so some of you
can continue competing in these games.
Really thinking right now,
I probably should have taken that $20K.
So if you didn't take the money
to go home,
why would you
sacrifice yourself for the team?
I feel like I have to sacrifice myself.
I just want people to know
I really do care about them.
And I wish more games
were like that. So…
[overlapping chatter]
I'm not going. I know you're not going.
I know he's not going.
-Who gon’ bite the bullets?
-[man] I'm not touching it, please!
Someone for the greater good
of the whole team has to leave.
-What's it look like down that way?
-It won't be me.
Nobody? Holy…
[MrBeast]
Oh, yeah, and guys, one more thing.
This game has already started,
and it will not end until
the last three rows to eliminate someone
will all be eliminated together.
Only nine of the 12 rows
will be moving on.
Come on!
Click it! Click it! Click it!
-[yells]
-Come on!
Oh! Whoa! That was quick.
-Let's go! Safe! [laughs]
-Congrats! Wait, come on.
Please! Please! Please!
-What's holding you back?
-Somebody else might do it.
Somebody!
Over there, just somebody,
push the button!
[yells]
What do we do? What do we do?
Come on!
-[cheering]
-[man] Let's go!
Don’t forget me!
[cheers and yells continue]
Yeah! Let’s go!
-[shrieks]
-Let's go! Let's go!
Come on, guys, or we’re all gonna go!
Press it! Press it!
[buzzes]
-Two!
-I’m not going!
-Darn it! Press it!
-Please, press it! Please! Please! Please!
Someone press it!
Press the button!
Press the button!
[piano music playing]
[yelling]
-Please!
-[man] Oh. One more, one more left.
Press the button! Press the button!
Press the f****** button!
-[cheers and yells continue]
-[music continues]
[sounds fade out]
-[yells and cheers]
-I did it.
[dramatic music intensifies]
-[wails]
-[man] Yeah!
You're welcome.
Win! Win! For your family… Please…
Win for your family…
I'll play for you, okay?
I got this. Okay, I got it. I got it.
Yeah! Yeah, baby!
We made it! We made it!
Our whole row was just eliminated.
My wife is still in there,
and it only takes one person
to win that $5,000,000, not two.
Good luck, babe. All the kids and I
will be rooting for you at home.
I'm trying not to cry. [laughs]
-[man] Yeah! Yeah!
-[cheering]
-I love you!
-I love you!
In a very platonic way, I love you.
-You took one for your team.
-I did.
All of these people deserve
a chance to win.
Whoa. How are you feeling?
Um, I’m sad.
Everyone in your row, give her a round
of applause for sacrificing herself.
[applause and cheers]
[clicks and beeps]
[screaming]
-[yells]
-[woman] Oh, my God!
-[yells]
-Oh! Oh, my God!
[yelling continues]
[cries and yells]
Now, a lot of you are probably wondering,
is it even possible to drop 80 people
at the same time?
And the answer is yes. Drop the row.

Lyrics

I am unwritten, can't read my mind,
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand,
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes,
But I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

🌻 Good morning friends, how is your day going?
📺 Are you looking for relaxation, positivity and energy for the new day? This will be the perfect place for you!

📌 The video begins with a warm and inviting Christmas coffee shop, where the festive spirit fills the air. At the center of the space, a red sofa set is perfectly arranged to provide a cozy spot for visitors. Beside it, a large crackling fireplace gently, radiating warmth and casting a soft glow across the room. Nearby, a beautifully decorated Christmas tree stands tall, adorned with shimmering LED lights, colorful ornaments, and a glowing star on top. Adjacent to the tree is a charming coffee bar with a few wooden stools. The bar is equipped with a modern coffee machine, neatly arranged coffee cups, and softly flickering candles. Above the bar, a string of warm LED lights hangs, adding a magical touch to the ambience.

🎄 Through the wooden fence of the coffee shop, the view opens to a serene winter night. A tranquil lake reflects the snowy landscape, as delicate snowflakes fall gently from the sky. Across the lake, a few cozy wooden cabins glow softly, their lights creating a picturesque scene. As smooth jazz melodies fill the cafe, the combination of music, warmth, and the enchanting winter setting creates a perfect holiday atmosphere.

💌 Hope you all will contribute ideas to help my channel grow more and more. That's also my motivation to make the next videos better

About Kes:
Of the many musical acts which call Trinidad & Tobago home, perhaps none embody its polyglot culture more than KES, the eclectic soca outfit behind some of modern Caribbean music’s most indelible anthems. Celebrated for Carnival hits (“Wotless,” “Savannah Grass”) and island pop jams (“Tuesday on the Rocks,” “Endless Summer”), the band has brought Trinidad to the world, sharing stages with the likes of Will Smith, Major Lazer and John Legend. For the group — charismatic singer Kees Dieffenthaler (aka KES) and his brothers Jon (guitar) and Hans (drums), along with childhood friend, Riad Boochoon (bass) —blending soca, pop, rock, reggae, calypso, dancehall and afrobeats together is one part of their greater calling: To spread good vibes. The last three years have proven to be the most successful in the band’s decade-plus-run. “Hello,” a fusion of afrobeats and soca originally released in 2017, continues to reach new audiences over two years after its release. With over 40 million plays on YouTube alone, it is one of the most streamed soca songs of all time. We Home, a live project recorded during the Covid-19 quarantine, is the band’s first album in over five years, with fresh renditions of KES’ carnival classics showcasing their prowess as a live band par excellence.

Lyrics:
I was in a sheer dress
The day that we met 
We were both in a rush 
We talked for a sec 
Your friend hit me up 
So we could connect
And what are the odds 
You send me a text 
And now the next 
Thing I know I’m like 
Manifest
That you’re oversized 
I digress 
Got me scrollin’ like 
Out of breath 
Got me going like 
Oooo ahhhhh 
 
Who’s the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent like 
(Ahhhhh) 
Maybe it’s all in my head 
 
But I bet we’d have really good bed chem 
How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yea I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good 
 
Come right on me 
I mean camaraderie    
Said you’re not in my time zone but you wanna be 
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me? 
See it my mind let’s fulfill the prophecy 
 
Who’s the cute guy with wide blue eyes and the big bad mmm like 
I know I sound a bit redundant 
 
But I bet we’d have really good bed chem 
How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yeah I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good 
Bed chem 
 
And I bet we’d both arrive at the same time 
And I bet the thermostats set at six nine 
And I bet it’s even better than in my head 


How you pick me up pull ‘em down turn me round oh it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you’re doing bad things 
That’s bed chem 
How you’re looking at me yeah I know what that means and 
I’m obsessed
Are you free next week? 
I’d bet we’d have really good

Lyrics of Chikni Chameli - चिकनी चमेली
bicchu mere naina, badi zeherili ankkh maare
kamsin kamriya saali ik thumke se lakh maare
haye bicchu mere naina, badi zeherili ankkh maare
kamsin kamriya saali ik thumke se lakh maare
note hazaaro ke khulla chhutta karaane aayi
husn ki teeli se beedi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhupke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

jungle me aaj mangal karungi bhukhe shero se khelugi main
makkhan jaisi hatheli pe jalte angaare le lungi main
haye gehre paani ki machhli hu raja
ghsat ghsat dariya me ghumi hu main
teri nazron ki lehero se haar ke aaj dubi hu mai
hoye jaanleva jalwa hai, dekhne me halwa hai
jaanleva jalwa hai, hai dekhne me halwa hai
pyaar se paros doongi toot le zara
ye to trailer hai, puri film dikhaane aayi
husn ki teeli se bidi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

banjar basti me aayi hai masti aisa namkin chehra tera
meri niyat pe chad gaya chhute na hai rang gehra tera
joban ye mera khenchi hai raja saare pardo ko katungi main
shaame meri akeli hai aaja sang tere baatungi main
haye baato me ishaara hai, jisme khel saara hai
baato me ishara hai jisme khel saara hai
tod ke tijoriyo ko loot le zara
choom ke zakhmo pe thoda malham lagaane aayi
husn ki teeli se beedi chillam jalaane aayi
aayi chikni aayi, aayi chikni aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi
aayi chikni chameli chhup ke akeli pavva chadhake aayi

Lyrics:

Yeh Bhi Na Jaane
Woh Bhi Na Jaane
Naino Ke Rang Naina Jaane
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Jag Ki Koi Reet Na Jaane
Main Toh Bas Teri Hui Deewani
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Teri Hi Baatein Ho
Subah Si Raatein Ho
Jab Se Mila Hai Tu
Dil Ko Mila Sukoon
Tu Hi Raah Meri, Tu Hi Safar Hai
Teri Baahon Mein, Ab Mera Ghar Hai

Chain Na Jaane Dard Na Jaane
Dil Toh Bas Dil Ko Pehchaane
Mila Jo Sang Tera
Uda Patang Mera
Hawa Mein Hoke Malang

Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera
O Makhna Ve Makhna
Main Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
O Makhna...

Chhod Aayi Ghar Baar Mera
Ab Tu Hi Hai Sansaar Mera
Yeh Paagal Sa Hai Pyaar Mera

🎵 Lyrics:

Uh, uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh, do you do this often?
I know it sound wrong, like, everything I left in Maryland
I just don't wanna see myself anymore, I don't
They, like, they say they miss me and shit, shut up, for real, like, man
Look, 'kay

[Verse]
DJ, run it back, play my song in this bitch
Vibin' like I'm alone in this bitch, mm
Tit for tat, I got your back, was I wrong for that shit?
Tell me, is we too grown for that shit? Uh
I wanna lock it in, baby, no weighin' my options
Wanna travel, see the world, gettin' drunk on an island
Wanna settle, start a family, so tell me about it
And you so perfect, baby, don't give nobody that body (Okay)
Social anxiety, I fear
And I done been this way for some years
I don't really get along with my peers
Everything that they do to me is weird
So in a world full of weirdos, fools, and scrubs
Tell me, what is it you're willin' to do for love?
You know it's true that the datin' pool is fucked
Ain't nobody out here, baby, it just be us
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know a broken heart when I see one
And I feel, and I feel, and I feel, and I feel like I love you more
Did you know? Do you know? Did you know? Do you know I'm a shoulder if you need one?
When I feel what I feel, keep it real, what’s the deal? I'm ready for
Oh, somewhere we could be alone, you and me alone
I remember bein' twenty-one when my life had just begun
Twenty-two, many things to see and do
Twenty-three, lookin' forward to twenty-four
Is it just me or it ain't no love no more?
Twenty-five, what a time to be alive
Am I getting old? Why do I feel tired?
All the same old things, the same old games
Same old pain, think it's time for a change 'cause
Certain shit ain't like me no more
Certain shit don't excite me no more
It don't excite no more, no
It ain't like me no more
No more, no more
No, no, no, no, no
Certain shit don't excite me no more
Shit ain't like me no more
This ain't like me no more, no
It don't excite me no more, uh",Rap City,"Rap City, RapCity, Rap Music, Rap, Rap Channel, Rap Channels, Hip-Hop, Hip Hop, R&B, Rap Music Channel, Rod Wave - 25 (Lyrics), rod wave 25, rod wave last lap, last lap, ro dwave 25 lyrics, rod wave 25 video, 25 rod wave, 25 rod wave lyrics, rod wave new album, new rod wave, rod wave new music, rod wave 25 lyrics, 25 lyrics, 25",10,"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_music, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pop_music",2024-10-11T17:35:07Z,PT3M1S,6652289,1037,False,No Caption,No Location

(20% Christmas Sale for Whole Shop, Too!!)


You've just found a lost production tape to the 2D animated pilot for Amanda The Adventurer! Pop it in and watch Amanda and Wooly play Hide and Seek again! And Again! And Again! And-- Wait... Seems Amanda would rather play something else... Wouldn't you like to Play Her Way?


It’s finally here!! The full music video for our song “Play My Way”! Not only that, it’s an official music video this time!! Ain’t that fun??
Originally when we started working on this, this was going to be a simple lyric video for the sake of time. We struggle to half do anything though, and this is now one of our most ambitious projects! Jax Toy will most likely be even more ambitious visually, but this music video is definitely an accumulation of the skills we’ve learned from our last projects INCLUDING Jax Toy!

All the Team Neutron members that got to work on this were firing on all cylinders! Adding their own flavor to any tasks they chose or were given, with a few new breakout artists that had this be their FIRST team neutron project!

I kind of crunched myself a lot with this video, during a time where money was extremely tight, but I’m sure the quality jump from Don’t Listen will be worth it. So I hope you all enjoy!

Lyrics

I am unwritten, can't read my mind,
I'm undefined
I'm just beginning, the pen's in my hand,
Ending unplanned

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

I break tradition, sometimes my tries
Are outside the line
We've been conditioned to not make mistakes,
But I can't live that way

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

The rest is still unwritten

Staring at the blank page before you
Open up the dirty window
Let the sun illuminate the words that you could not find

Reaching for something in the distance
So close you can almost taste it
Release your inhibitions

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open
Today is where your book begins

Feel the rain on your skin
No one else can feel it for you
Only you can let it in
No one else, no one else
Can speak the words on your lips
Drench yourself in words unspoken
Live your life with arms wide open

Ci vediamo in Tour nel 2025 🎟️ https://www.ticketone.it/artist/me-contro-te/

TESTO:
Scusate per l’attesa
Non volevamo drammi
Aspetti sto momento fra da tipo 7 anni

Ma che c’hai ti vedo pallido 
Con due video ho fatto il panico 
Noi con il disco di platino 
Voi con il vizio dei plagi bro 

Da quanto ci copi la roba virale
 Dovresti pagare la percentuaaaale
Abbiamo fatto anche il film di Natale
Voi al massimo vi fate un film ma mentale

We bro we bro 
Benvenuto, welcome
Forse mi hai visto su webboh
Cos’è che fai te sul web? boh

Dai tempi d’oro di YouTube italia da quando c’era favij 
Se vuoi fare il drama ama vi facciamo sciogliere un po’ come i Mates 

E Fate cose un po’ diverse
Non che rifate le stesse
Quale Fedez contro Tony effe 
Voglion tutti noi col signor S

Smascherarvi era una missione
Voglio Dario Moccia come autore 
Ma chi volete superare?
Forse sto dissing vi ha fatto male

Dici non lo faccio apposta
questa è violazione del copyright
Se vuoi abbiamo fatto anche il podcast
ecco un’altra cosa che copierai

Siete solo una copia copia copia copia

LYRICS

[CRAFTYCORN]
Season’s here
No unhappiness welcome near
Go around and then spread some cheer
In the Playcare nothing to fear
Oh

[DOGDAY]
We'll keep the days bright
Smiling without daylight
Just don't fall asleep

[PICKY PIGGY]
Feel a little funny
Yucky in my tummy
Uh-oh oh, don't you go!

[BOBBY BEARHUG]
Children scream and shout
What the season's all about
Just making money! Ah-ah, Making money! Ah-ah

[CATNAP]
Sleeping safe and sound
Till their time has come around
Just making money! Ah-ah, Making money! Ah-ah!

[HOPPY HOPSCOTCH]
Getting whatcha want for this Christmas
Never wanna question this business
Hoping you're forgetting what you witnessed

[ALL CRITTERS]

[BUBBA BUBBAPHANT]
We were all smart Young Geniuses
And now we can help other kids

[CRAFTYCORN]
We might be orphans, 
But we have more fun!

[KICKINCHICKEN]
We keep the days bright
When we miss the sunlight
Please don't fall asleep
(You have to stay up!)

[PICKY PIGGY]
Feel a little funny
Yucky in my tummy
Uh-oh oh, don't you go!

[BOBBY BEARHUG]
Children scream and shout

Hoping you're forgetting what you witnessed

[ALL CRITTERS]
Playtime Holiday!

[CATNAP]
Could it all be in my head? 
Are my friends alive or dead?

[HOPPY HOPSCOTCH]
If there could be one thing I ask for this year
I'd wanna just leave and get out of here! 

[DOGDAY]
Children scream and shout
What the season's all about
Just making money! Ah-ah, Making money! Ah-ah

Oh my gosh, I'm so excited to go back to the Playcare, 
I haven't been happy in so long, 
I can't wait to see the smiling critters!

Hi, hello, it's been a while
Since I've seen your happy smile
We're so glad you came to see
Your best friends on the TV
Red, blue, orange and green,
Yellow and our piggy-pink
Yeah that's it, there's no more
Purple can just be ignored

Hey, hi, no more jitters
Happier with Smiling Critters
Make the bad times go away
Candy dreams and rainbow days

Bobby BearHug, CraftyCorn, 
Bubba Bubbaphant, hooray!
Hoppy Hopscotch, KickinChicken, 
PickyPiggy, DogDay

S-M-I-L-E everyday, you and me!
S-M-I-L-E everyday, you and me!

We're still smiling everyday, 
there's really no other way

Oh my gosh thank you guys for joining us here, 
we are going to have so much fun today!
So what is there to do in the Playcare?
There are so many games to play, 
and everyone is talented in their own way!

CraftyCorn does art, Bobby's got the heart, and
Bubba's good with school, KickinChicken's cool
Yeah, Piggy loves to eat, Hoppy loves to run
And DogDay makes sure we're all having fun!

CatNap's not invited
CatNap's not invited

Hey, hi, no more jitters
Happier with Smiling Critters
Make the bad times go away
Candy dreams and rainbow days

Bobby BearHug, CraftyCorn, 
Bubba Bubbaphant, hooray!

Lyrics:- 
Tum paas aaye yun muskuraaye
Tum paas aaye yun muskuraaye
Tumne na jane kya sapne dikaaye
Tum paas aaye yun muskuraaye
Tumne na jane kya sapne dikaaye
Ab to mera dil jage na sota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai


Tum paas aaye yun muskuraaye
Tumne na jane kya sapne dikaaye
Ab to mera dil jage na sota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai


Na jane kaisa ehsaas hai
Bujhti nahin hai kya pyaas hai
Kya nasha is pyaar ka
Mujhpe sanam chhaane laga
Koi na jane kyun chain khota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai…


Kya rang layi meri duaan
Ye ishq jane kaise hua
Baichaineeyon mein chain
Na jane kyun aane laga
Tanhai mein dil yaadein sanjota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai


Tum paas aaye yun muskuraaye
Tumne na jane kya sapne dikhaye
Tum paas aaye yun muskuraaye
Tumne na jane kya sapne dikhaye
Ab to mera dil jage na sota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai
Kya karun hai kuch kuch hota hai…

🎤 Lyrics: Céline Dion - I Love You

[Intro]
I must be crazy now
Maybe I dream too much
But when I think of you
I long to feel your touch

[Verse 1]
To whisper in your ear
Words that are old as time
Words only you would hear
If only you were mine
I wish I could go back to the very first day I saw you
Should've made my move when you looked in my eyes
'Cause by now I know that you'd feel the way that I do
And I'd whisper these words as you'd lie here by my side

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 2]
So today, I finally find the courage deep inside
Just to walk right up to your door
But my body can't move when I finally get to it
Just like a thousand times before
Then without a word he handed me this letter
Read I hope this finds the way into your heart, it said

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Verse 3]
Well maybe I, I need a little love yeah
And maybe I, I need a little care
And maybe I, maybe you, maybe you, maybe you
Oh you need somebody just to hold you
If you do, just reach out and I'll be there

[Chorus]
I love you, please say
You love me too, these three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Till the end of time

[Outro]
These three words
They could change our lives forever
And I promise you that we will always be together
Oh, I love you
Please say you love me too
Please please
Say you love me too
Till the end of time
My baby
Together, together, forever
Till the end of time
I love you
I will be your light
Shining bright
Shining through your eyes
My baby

Lyrics:
দেখে তোরে মনে ধরেছে 
ওরে ও সুন্দরী।
আকাশ থেকে নামলো বুঝি
ডানা ছাড়া পরী।

কতো পাগল দেখছি আমি 
করে ঘোরাঘুরি।
যতই করিস তুই হিরোগিরি
 হবে না মন  চুরি।

তোর ডাগর ডাগর চোখে 
কালো কাজল মেখে
নিলিরে দিন দুপুরে পরান কাড়িয়া।
আমার দুই চাক্কার সাইকেলে বসাইয়া।
তোরে দেখামু শহর ঘুরাইয়া।
আমার কাজ নাইরে আর খাইয়া দাইয়া।
আমি ঘুরতে যামু সাইকেলে বইয়া।

লাগবেরে হাওয়া হাওয়া উড়বেরে চুল
দেখবোরে মনটা ভরে।
না না না 
পড়বো না তোর ফাঁন্দে ধরা
লাভ নাইরে পিছে ঘুরে।

ডাগর ডাগর চোখে 
কালো কাজল মেখে
নিলিরে তুই দিন দুপুরে পরান কাড়িয়া। 
আমার কাজ নাইরে আর খাইয়া দাইয়া।
আমি ঘুরতে যামু সাইকেলে বইয়া।

হাওয়ারি বেগে বেগে চলবে সাইকেল
তোরে লইয়ারে সাথে।
কে করবে তোর ইচ্ছে পুরন
সময় নাই যে হাতে।
তোর ডাগর ডাগর চোখে 
কালো কাজল মেখে
নিলিরে তুই দিন দুপুরে পরান কাড়িয়া।
আমার কাজ নাইরে আর খাইয়া দাইয়া।
আমি ঘুরতে যামু সাইকেলে বইয়া।

Dekhe tore mone dhoreche 
Ore o sundori 
Akash thaika namlo bujhi 
Dana chara pori 
Koto pagol dekhechi ami

Tor dagor dagor chokhe 
Kalo kajol mekhe nilire 
Din dupure poran kariya 
Amar dui chakkar cycle a 
Boshaya tore dekhamu 
Sohor ghuraya 
Amar kaj naire r khaiya 
Daiya ami ghurte jamu cycle a

Lagbere hawa hawa orbere chul 
Dekhbore monta vore

Porbona tur fande dhora 
Lab naire piche ghure 

Tor dagor dagor chokhe 
Kalo kajol mekhe nilire

Amar dui chakkar cycle a 
Boshaya tore dekhamu

Dekhbore monta bhore 
Ke korbe tor ecche puron 
Shomoy nai amar hate 
 

Tor dagor dagor chokhe 
Kalo kajol mekhe nilire 
Din dupure poran kariya 
Amar dui chakkar cycle a 
Boshaya tore dekhamu 
Sohor ghuraya 
Amar kaj naire r khaiya 
Daiya ami ghurte jamu cycle a

Dirampungi delik-delikane
Podo terimo kahanane

TV ne mati, lampune yo mati
Koyok peteng ati iki
Deg-degkan ngenteni ending cerito
Mergo wes kebacot gowo roso

Tapi ramungkin iso sesandingan

Kopi... pait dadi kancaku
Dadi saksi dalan ceritoku
Perjalanan tresno seng kleru

Lirik
Kala kupandang kerlip bintang nun jauh disana
Saat kudenger melodi cinta yang menggema
Terasa kembali gelora jiwa mudaku
Karna tersentuh alunan lagu semerdu kopi dangdut

Api asmara yang dahulu pernah membara
Semakin hangat bagai ciuman yang pertama
Detak jantungku seakan ikut irama
karna terlena oleh pesona alunan kopi dangdut

Irama kopi dangdut yang ceria
Menyengat hati menjadi gairah
membuat aku lupa akan cintaku yang telah lalu

Api asmara yang dahulu pernah membara
Semakin hangat bagai ciuman yang pertama
Detak jantungku seakan ikut irama
Karna terlena oleh pesona alunan kopi dangdut

   ******Temporary Pyar Lyrics*****

Rovengi Muqaddaran Nu Heere Meriye
Je Heereyan De Haar Jeha Yaar Kho Gaya
Hunn Mainu Dass Kinna Pyar Kardi
Labhdi Firengi Je Faraar Ho Gaya
Mera Eh Gulaab Manzoor Karle
Sach Kehna Mainu Sacha Pyar Ho Gaya
Side Te Tu Apna Guroor Kar Lai
Vekh Ajj Methon Izhaar Ho Gaya
Darling Umar’an Da Waada Karde
Darling Umar’an Da Waada Karde
Temporary Pyar Badi Waar Ho Gaya
Rovengi Muqaddaran Nu Heere Meriye
Je Heereyan De Haar Jeha Yaar Kho Gaya
Sab Bhulja Puraane Tere Layak Nahi
Mere Bina Tera Koyi Nayak Nahi
Teri Agge Di Kahani Tu Mere Te Chadd De
Hon Denda Kuch Dukh Dayak Nahi
Tainu Dil Naal Sada Lake Rakhunga
Tainu Dil Naal Sada Laake Rakhunga
Khushiyan Daunga Pehredaar Ho Gaya
Rovengi Muqaddaran Nu Heere Meriye
Je Heereyan De Haar Jeha Yaar Kho Gaya
Dekh Asmaan Vich Taare Kinne Aa
Main Taare Dekh Waqt Gujare Kinne Aa
Main Jazbaat Mere Maare Kinne Aa
Dil Vich Khwab Vi Usaare Kinne Aa
Par Dil Leke Mera Je Tu Dil Na Davein
Dil Leke Mera Je Tu Dil Na Davein
Kahda Sala Pyar Ae Vyapaar Ho Gaya
Rovengi Muqaddaran Nu Heere Meriye
Je Heereyan De Haar Jeha Yaar Kho Gaya
Mainu Thukrake Na Tu Hor Chun Layin
Mere Bina Kisey Da Na Geet Sun Layin
Mainu Padh Mainu Likh Mainu Gaya Kar
Mere Naam Da Hi Baanh Utte
Tattoo Khoon Layi
Tere Mere Past Ch Pyar Jo Rahe
Tere Mere Past Ch Pyar Jo Rahe
Soch Ohna Da Antim Sanskar Ho Gaya
Rovengi Muqaddaran Nu Heere Meriye
Je Heereyan De Haar Jeha Yaar Kho Gaya
Lad Jinna Marji Tu Cheekh Mere Te
Par Soch Karle Bareek Mere Te
Niyat Meri Taan Hogi Leak Tere Te
Teri Nigaah Kyun Hai Theek Theek Mere Te
Jinni Marzi Dafa Hoja Mere Ton Khafa
Jinni Marzi Dafa Hoja Mere Ton Khafa
Main Launga Mana Ikraar Ho Gaya
Rovengi Muqaddaran Nu Heere Meriye
Je Heereyan De Haar Jeha Yaar Kho Gaya

Synopsis:
India’s top agent Kabir (Hrithik Roshan) leads the Elite Shadow Unit of R&AW, a compact group of the crème de la crème of the armed forces who are personally trained by him and work with him on various high-risk missions across the world. Among Kabir and Colonel Luthra’s key targets are an international arms baron Rizwan Ilyasi who has been key in various acts of terrorism against the country. 

Khalid (Tiger Shroff) has fought his way up the ranks of the Indian armed forces. His greatest challenge and battle has been to fight against the sins of his father, once a decorated soldier working with Kabir who had turned a traitor. His ambition has been to join Kabir’s team to remove any stains on their family name. Kabir is not keen due to their past history, but Colonel Luthra requests him to, and gradually Kabir is also impressed by Khalid’s intense dedication and grit. Khalid becomes Kabir’s greatest soldier ever, flirting with death repeatedly in mission after mission as they go after the country’s enemies, including a mission against Rizwan Ilyasi that nearly kills Khalid. 

But Khalid’s greatest mission, his toughest yet, is still to come. When his own mentor Kabir turns rogue and starts to go after top officials and scientists and officers in the Indian establishment, targeting and executing them viciously across the world.  

Colonel Luthra is unsure if Khalid has it in him to go after Kabir. Is he clever enough to hunt the man who trained him, and even if he does get him, does he have it in him to put a bullet in his hero’s head? Luthra advises Khalid against the mission but he insists – he is the best protégé and the only one who can track the mentor. And only Kabir can answer the crucial question – why did he turn rogue? 

A vicious cat and mouse game ensues as protégé goes after mentor in a war that spills across the globe. As the chase unravels both Kabir and Khalid begin to finally realize, what desperate stakes really drive them in this terrifying war.

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?!

Oʻylab qolaman, oʻtkinchi olam,
Mol-dunyoga buncha oʻch bu odam?
Choʻntak boʻsh boʻlsa bosma qadam,
Mensimasdan qarar koʻz qiridan.

Sezmay qolaman, aldaydi odam,
Qoʻrqmaydi, harom non yer hiyladan.
Maqsad — sotish, hatto sotuvda badan,
Tavba qil, qoʻrq olov taftidan.

Unutma, ey inson, bu — foniy dunyo,
Boʻlma razil, tushdamassan, bu — roʻyo.
Oʻylaysan hammasi yaxshidek goʻyo,
Sen sabab yo haq, yo nohaq bu dunyo.

Tuzilgan shunaqa “qora dastur”,
Piyodasan, yoʻqmi moshina — ozgina past tur.
Boy kasal boʻlsa, doʻxtirlar hammasi gʻamxoʻr,
Kambagʻalning joni ogʻrisa, “Navbatda jim tur!”

Boʻlsa boldi bitta yangi iPhone,
Oʻtdi vaqt maqsadsiz, doim birga shayton.
Qora Gentra, 3-4 soʻm pul, ol senga maydon,
Tulki, boʻri, ilon — oʻzi shularmi hayvon? 

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?! (2x)

Tan olaman, koʻp narsa bogʻliq pulga,
Suzmayman, mayli, qarshi oqimga.
Kechib ketdi bir chaqa deb, ogʻir botdi dilga,
Bor bogʻliq narsalar — pulgamas, koʻngilga. 

Aytaman bitta gapni oʻsha boy zoʻrlarga,
Savol-javob bitta joyda, sen va pulga zorlarga.
Sevgandim — berishmadi, doʻstman qora tunlarga,
Yor-yor bilan ketdi qasri borlarga.

Oʻylab qolaman, oʻtkinchi olam,
Mol-dunyoga buncha oʻch bu odam?
Choʻntak boʻsh boʻlsa bosma qadam,
Mensimasdan qarar koʻz qiridan.

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?!

Artist : Justy Aldrin, Wizz Baker, Toton Caribo

Lyrics : 
HILANG  

Ada yang hilang dan takkan kembali
Namun waktu memaksamu trus jalani
Lewati kerasnya hari penuh kerikil duri
Kawan , ingatlah kau tak sendiri

Bila kau berlari dan kakimu letih
Berhenti sejenak akan ku temani
Walau dunia tak peduli dan cinta tak kau temui 
Kawan , kami ada disini

Hilang hanya sebentar
Sudahi sedihmu kawan …..
Kelak kau kan percaya
Cinta kan sembuhkan luka 

Relakan apa yang pergi
Yakinkan pasti kembali
Lebih dari yang kau sadari


Kadang muncul nya bencana 
tanpa adanya rencana  
tangan di lipat 
Dan lutut berteguk ke tanah
semesta berpihak entah keemana ?

Kadang kau bimbang dan terus  bertanya  
Tak seimbang hidup ku dengan tetangga 
walau di gubuk tak sebanding mreka  
Yg tinggal 
rumah ber tangga 



Ada sebab apa penyebab 
Tuhan kenapa terjadi ledak?   Aer di klilingi api 
Dermaga menangis kuat tuk hadapi 

Langit cerah asap yg gelap 
Angin membius jiwa terlelap 
KAMI PERCAYA  engkau lah kiblat 
kebaikan mu selalu tingalkan jejak


Kadang kau sesali semua yang terjadi
Lupakan sejenak , tetap kau syukuri
Ada yang datang dan pergi janganlah kau bersedih
Di depan masih ada matahari


Kadang terjatuh
Kadang kau rapuh
Jangan ragu
Aku ada untukmu

Hilang hanya sebentar
Sudahi sedihmu kawan …..
Kelak kau kan percaya
Cinta kan sembuhkan luka 

Relakan apa yang pergi
Yakinkan pasti kembali
Lebih dari yang kau sadari

Ils se demandent comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, hmm-hmm
Ils se demandent com-comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, ils-ils veulent pas prendre les mêmes risques que moi
Mais comment j'ai fait ?
Ils se demandent, ils me voient dans le féfé
Ils se demandent, télécommandés, ils sont télécommandés
Dépose ta batte, viens te battre (oh oui)
Si t'es cap, si t'es cap (oh oui)
Toi t'es bonne qu'à faire des captures (oh oui)
Tu m'épates, tu m'épates
Non je rigole
Dépose ta batte, viens te battre (oh oui)
Je vais te mettre à quatre pattes (oh oui)

Je vais, je vais te mettre à quatre pattes
Nan-nan-nan-nan-nan-nan
Da-da-da-da-da-da

Ils se demandent, ils-ils veulent pas prendre les mêmes risques que moi
Mais comment j'ai fait ?
Ils se demandent, ils me voient dans le fé-fé
Ils se demandent, télécommandés, ils sont télécommandés
Ils se demandent

Qui a cru que j'allais faire du son
Eh, j'ai trop flairé regarde où je suis maintenant
Tout ce que je fais ça fonctionne

Et l'échec, c'est une condition de la réussite, hein
On est là comme on est
Si vous êtes les meilleurs, soyez les meilleurs
Peu importe ce que vous faites, croyez en vous
Bélièvre

Déposes ta batte, viens te battre
Je vais te mettre à quatre pattes
Je vais, je vais te mettre à quatre pattes

Faut qu'j'pense à moi avant d'penser à nous (Penser à nous), y a que allongé que j'donne de l'amour (De l'amour)
Et sans la monnaie, j'ai même plus d'humour (Plus d'humour), tout comme ton henné, j'serai plus là un jour
Du mal (Du mal), j'te f'rai et ça m'déplaît, t'es mon secret dans mon game play (Hey)
J'ai des jouets, j'ai mon bulletproof, bae, dans la gue-dro, y a pour tous les goûts
J'irai dehors parce que faut les sous, nan, j'pourrai pas être présent tous les jours
J'ai mal (J'ai mal), je serre, que j'me resserre, Barça ou Rotter', que des gros tehs

[Refrain]
J'suis bloqué dans sa tête, c'est moi contre elle, en un contre un
Mon partenaire d'enfer, c'est top secret, c'est sous contrat
J'suis confiant, si ça pète, c'est sûr que personne racontera
Elle est as-p dans les nanani naninana (Nani nanina)

[Couplet 2]
J'protège ton trône (J'protège ton trône), queen, soit décontracte (Soit décontracte)
Jusqu'à l'overdose (Jusqu'à l'overdose) quand on s'recontacte (On s'recontacte)
J'en raconte trop (Faut qu'j'me taise) mais c'est sous contrôle (Baby)
J'sens qu'l'amour me frôle (Pour de vrai) quand elle m'épaule (Quand elle m'épaule, bloqué dans sa—)

[Refrain]
J'suis bloqué dans sa tête, c'est moi contre elle, en un contre un
Mon partenaire d'enfer, c'est top secret, c'est sous contrat
J'suis confiant, si ça pète, c'est sûr que personne racontera
Elle est as-p dans les nanani naninana (Nani nanina)

Kids Fun TV:
Kids Fun TV, also known as the Fun Squad, is a fun family friendly channel created by the Skye family. Whether it’s games or fun action skits, the kids and their parents love to have fun and play. We have lots of boys vs girls competition videos as well as twin vs twin games. We love box forts, toys and playing fun and exciting games. Whether it’s playing jokes on their dad with a toy, having an amazing birthday party, singing cover songs, creating movie remakes or having a fun superhero adventure, these funny kids love to have fun and play. Sneaky as a spy and skilled as a ninja, the Fun Squad members team up and work together to solve a mystery in each skit adventure. The children (Jack Skye, Jazzy Skye, Kade Skye, Kalia Skye and Kyler Skye) love to have lots of family fun (with Mom and Dad also) in their skits and games. 
The Kids Fun TV channel loves making fun videos for kids and fun videos for ages 13 and older.

Pertemuan 2

Betapa hati tak bahagia
Bila kekasih yang lama kurindukan kini dia datang
Dia datang seperti dahulu
Setelah lama meninggalkan diriku sepi sendiri

Alangkah bahagia pertemuanku kali ini
Setelah berpisah sekian lamanya
Semoga selamanya dia berada di sisiku
Tiada pergi lagi tiada sunyi lagi

Sampai akhir nanti selalu berdua
Betapa hati tak bahagia
Bila kekasih yang lama kurindukan kini dia datang
Dia datang seperti dahulu
Setelah lama meninggalkan diriku sepi sendiri

Lyrics | كلمات

دوالي، صوت محبوبي، دوا لي
من نظرة عينها أخذت دوا لي
إجت على حيلي الفيه دوالي
تلفَّ كل عروق إيديي
قربي لجاي لمستك وشفتك
دخيل الكون عيونك وشفتك
دخيل الكون عيونك وشفتك
بيخلّي المتين يحنّي يا ياال حبّايب

أنا ورد بس ورد نرجس
كلّي برد بس صعب أرجف 
مش رمية نرد
هيدا تعبِي تعبِي هيدا تعبِي 
أنا ورد بس ورد نرجس
اسمي كافي خلّيني عَجرف
مش رمية نرد
هيدا تعبِ تعبِ هيدا تعبِ 
انا ل ارسم وجهك على القلب
ما حدّ يلمسك لا و حق الرب
لو تطلب قلب  لفرش درب
ما يغلى عليكي كل هالدنيا
لو حرقت قلبي بالنهار
بقيو عيوني بنار
حرموا جفوني النوم
اعتدت السهر يا  قليبي نام 
عودي برضى قلبي فداها يا ما نداك يصرخ أذى
برسم خطاها عودي بِهدا عودي برضى قلبي فدا

أنا ورد بس ورد نرجس
كلّي برد بس صعب أرجف 
مش رمية نرد
 هيدا تعبِي تعبِي هيدا تعبِي 
أنا ورد بس ورد نرجس
اسمي كافي خلّيني عَجرف
مش رمية نرد
هيدا هيدا تعبِ تعبِ هيدا تعبِ 

دوالي، صوت محبوبي، دوا لي
من نظرة عينها أخذت دوا لي
إجت على حيلي الفيه دوالي
تلفَّ كل عروق إيديي
برسم خطاك

عودي برضى

*Lirik ‘Tak Sedalam Ini’ :*

Jangan kau obati luka ini
Biarkan mengalir darah tak henti
Ku tahu kau hanya membuat lukaku semakin perih
Kini kau datang, esok kau pergi
Seakan engkau tak punya hati

Terlalu aku mencintaimu
Rupanya kesempatan bagimu
Maafku untukmu berulang kali, tapi tiada arti
Kini denganku, esok dengannya
Aku tak sanggup lagi

Sakitnya, perihnya
Melihat kau bercumbu dengannya
Kau tega menyiksa
Aku yang selalu setia

Andai rasa di hati tak sedalam ini
Dari dahulu engkau tlah ku tinggalkan
Cinta yang ku miliki tak bisa kau bandingkan
Rugilah engkau kerna memilih dia

Terlalu aku mencintaimu
Rupanya kesempatan bagimu
Maafku untukmu berulang kali, tapi tiada arti
Kini denganku, esok dengannya
Aku tak sanggup lagi

Sakitnya, perihnya
Melihat kau bercumbu dengannya
Kau tega menyiksa
Aku yang selalu setia

Andai rasa di hati tak sedalam ini
Dari dahulu engkau tlah ku tinggalkan
Cinta yang ku miliki tak bisa kau bandingkan
Rugilah engkau kerna memilih dia

(Lyrics/Paroles):
Ils se demandent comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, hmm-hmm
Ils se demandent com-comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, ils-ils veulent pas prendre les mêmes risques que moi
Mais comment j'ai fait ?
Ils se demandent, ils me voient dans le féfé
Ils se demandent, télécommandés, ils sont télécommandés
Dépose ta batte, viens te battre (oh oui)
Si t'es cap, si t'es cap (oh oui)
Toi t'es bonne qu'à faire des captures (oh oui)
Tu m'épates, tu m'épates
Non je rigole
Dépose ta batte, viens te battre (oh oui)
Je vais te mettre à quatre pattes (oh oui)

Je vais, je vais te mettre à quatre pattes
Nan-nan-nan-nan-nan-nan
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Ils se demandent comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, hmm-hmm
Ils se demandent, com-comment j'ai fait
Ils se demandent, ils-ils veulent pas prendre les mêmes risques que moi
Mais comment j'ai fait ?
Ils se demandent, ils me voient dans le fé-fé
Ils se demandent, télécommandés, ils sont télécommandés
Ils se demandent

Qui a cru que j'allais faire du son
Eh, j'ai trop flairé regarde où je suis maintenant
Tout ce que je fais ça fonctionne

Et l'échec, c'est une condition de la réussite, hein
On est là comme on est
Si vous êtes les meilleurs, soyez les meilleurs
Peu importe ce que vous faites, croyez en vous
Bélièvre

Déposes ta batte, viens te battre
Je vais te mettre à quatre pattes
Je vais, je vais te mettre à quatre pattes
Nananananananana

I just wanna blow shit up
Love it. Blow shit up.
Don't care. Let's riot.
I bring a bomb to a fist fight

In chaos I reign
Tear this place apart
Rebel heart
In chaos I'm free
Destruction is art
Rebel heart

Don't you want be vicious
Don't you want to tell lies
Come join me on the dark side 
It's a paradise
No rules
Pure mayhem
That is who I am
and I watch you do it as we tear it down
Burn it to the ground

In chaos I reign
Tear this place apart
Rebel heart
In chaos I'm free
Destruction is art
Rebel heart

I've been here from the very start
I will give you my rebel heart
I've been here from the very start
You cannot break my rebel heart

In chaos I reign
Tear this place apart
Rebel heart
In chaos I'm free
Destruction is art
Rebel heart

It's chaos
All chaos
I'll give my
Rebel heart
It's chaos
Just chaos
Inside my
Rebel heart

Lyrics | الكلمات

بتطلع عنفسيتي بتعرف فيني هم
وين بروح بحالي ارضي كلها سم
الصبر والقوة دافع حقن دم
زرعت ورد لناس ما بتعرف تشم

صفنت الشمعة ونزلت دمعة
بوقت الكل كسرني
مسحت الدمعة لأطفي الشمعة
القوة بذاتها رادتني
قلبي ياخدني ع طريقك
كلمة ب شِعري تشعل حريقك
عبوابك واقف حتى صيدك
حالف تتكوني من نصيبي

خيَّال خيَّال .. خيَّال خيَّال
رح تتحامي بظهر رجال
وانا من الباب والله ترحال 
فرس اصيلة وبدها خيال
و مخدرة هالبال
اصبر مابقدر من هالجمال
طالب ايدك انا بالحلال ..

وانا تشهدلي الأرض 
عدوي كان مرافقني فرض
حابس جوا قلبي الجراح
نشلتو وصار نقطة بالنرد

المعركة يلي بتفوت فيا .. 
يا بتنهيك ! يا بتنهيا !!

وأنا رح انهيا ..! حارقها باللي فيا ..!
مدمر بُكرة أبيها ..! جرح قلبي مخزن اذية ..!

وأنا رح انهيا ..! حارقها باللي فيا ..!
مدمر بُكرة أبيها ..! بنت قلبي هايا البنية ..!

بس من بعد فترة الضعف
رجعت خيال وايدي بالألف
تعد الكسرة وحدة وحدة وعالرف
كل عدة كانت ايدا والكف 
وتقلي على جرحي اصحى
والوجع صابني وقت الفرحة
كل كسرة تهدني بجبرها
وانا نفسي الله عاززها 

خيال .. خيال .. عشت عمري خيال
كاسر جناح طيري .. يضعف عندي مافي مجال !

خيال .. خيال .. عشت عمري خيال
لا ما رح شوفا لغيري .. وهيه بقلبي والله !",Odai - عدي,"أغاني عربية, أغاني عربية ٢٠٢٤, أغاني راب عربية ٢٠٢٤, new music, راب عربي, odai music, odai 2024, odai, عدي, عودي, oday, udai, جديد عدي, اجدد اغاني عدي, احدث اغاني عدي, عدي 2024, odai new, odai new song, Khyial, kyal, khyial, odai khyial, odai khyial 2024, خيال, وانا رح انهيا, حارقها باللي فيها, وانا تشهدلي الارض, المعركة يلي بتفوت فيها يا بتنهيك يا بتنهيا, فرس اصيلة, بوب, زرعت ورد لناس ما بتعرف تشم, كليب خيال",10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,2024-11-02T13:00:06Z,PT3M17S,5898345,5190,False,No Caption,No Location

Been quiet for a few months while we cooked this song along side other projects but it’s finally here! “Play My Way”, a song Co-written with my friend RecD, is a semi-sequel to “Don’t Listen” has arrived and has a music video in production too! I say semi since the contents of this song are explicitly based on those official Amanda pilot shorts we had been doing to help tease the game instead of contents from the sequel. (Though it’s amazing how many things in this song and that are planned for the music video that actually line up with the second game 🤭)

Honored to have the original voice of Amanda (Blair Greene-Osako) singing lead on this track, she performed amazing and we should all give her a round of applause!

Super happy to say Meelz returns to help deliver a spectacular guitar performance, and Toastymarshmellow is snuck in performing in the choir and backup vocals with JoshucaVA and Kathy-Chan!

Hope you all enjoy this second dive into Amanda’s musical universe!

Lyrics:

Hi my name’s Amanda
What’s your name?
Oh that sounds familiar…
Have we played this game?
 
Where one person hides and
You’ve gotta go find them
I’m looking for my friend
Wait, you think you see him?


In this tree, in this box
that’s a good hiding spot
gotta get this done
so we can have more fun!

Hey look, you found me!
I guess it’s my turn huh?

Or we could play another game! Maybe tag—
Wait amanda! I haven’t gotten a turn… can’t we just do one more round of hide n seek?
I guess… that’s only fair…


1 2 3 4
Uh… What comes next?
2 3 4 5
Oh right, you’re the best!
6 7 8 9
You must play this a lot
7 8 9 10
So ready or not 
Here I come?…

Oh no!
She could be anywhere!
Do you see Amanda?



Now watch us play our part
Now watch us dance and sing
Don’t want to fall apart
Like kids who never seem to scream

We get to play all day
But can we play my way
Got another game
So can you try it with me

(Close your eyes
Count to ten
Will you help me find my friend
Is she here
Is she there
I can’t find her anywhere)


Amanda Amanda!
Oh…
Amanda Amanda!




Hi my name’s Amanda
Oh hi it’s you again
We’re playing Hide n Seek
Seems like it never ends

Isn’t it getting boring?
We’d have more fun today
If we try something else
put hide and seek away 

I’ve been thinking
how we play tag
when i say YOU’RE IT!
and i run in zig zag
could we be happy
If we make believe
(Amanda.)
That we have a choice
What you play with me
(Amanda… Amanda!)

I’m ready to play it
I’m ready to-
(Amanda!)
WHAT
I know that you’re wanting to play tag but
It’s my turn now.
It’s MY turn now!
IT’s mY turN now!
IT’S MY TURN NOW!!— 


I WANT TO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE




Now watch us play our part
Now watch us dance and sing
Don’t let it break your heart
Just play along and never scream
AAAA 
We get to play all day
But can we play my way
Got another game
So can you try it with me



1 2 3 4
Is she just past this bush
2 3 4 5
or behind this old tree
6 7 8 9
I don’t think she’s down there
7 8 9 10
Please you must trust me
1 2 3 4
I don’t wanna go in there
2 3 4 5
I don’t wanna go in there
6 7 8 9
I don’t wanna go
7 8 9 10

(I don’t wanna go
I just wanna play my way
I don’t wanna go
I just wanna go home)

H-huh?... gasp

Looks like you found silly mister… FOX!!
AAAAAAAA



Now watch him fall apart
Now watch him gush and bleed
He had a beating heart
That ended with a little scream!
Now we can play all day 
And we will play my way 
made my own game 
So can you try it with me

Now watch us rip apart
Now watch us dance agape
Puppets with beating hearts
And strings made of magnetic tape 
We're cursed to play all day 
But never play our way 
Is there another game 
and could you try it for me




*giggling till sighing*


(Close your eyes
Count to ten
Will you help me find my friend
Is she here
Is she there
I can’t find her anywhere)

SMILING CRITTERS YOU ADORE
WHAT ABOUT YOUR THEODORE?
JUST A KID NOW TRAPPED INSIDE
TRAPPED INSIDE MY TWISTED MIND

JUST AN HOUR FILLED WITH JOY
THEN I MIGHT NOT BE YOUR TOY
TRAPPED INSIDE A NIGHTMARE
FINDING SOMEONE NEW TO  CARE

I WORSHIP THE PROTOTYPE
HE'S BEEN BUILDING ALL THE HYPE
NOW I WON'T GET LEFT BEHIND
I'M NOT CRAZY, I'M NOT BLIND 

I'M NOT CRAZY, I'M NOT BLIND!!
I'M NOT CRAZY, I'M NOT BLIND!!!
DON'T HATE ME BECAUSE YOU LIED
I DESERVE AN INVITE

Ughh i’m so sick of hearing smile everyday!!!

[SIMON SMOKE] 
Ahhh don't worry BaBa, soon enough it’ll be our turn hahaha!

Say hi to the bad times (Catfeine: What?)
Cry to the sad rhymes (Catfeine: No, no!!)
We are misery's company (DogDay: Not good...)
Rather be angy
Tired and hangry (Picky Piggy: Wow!)
Don't care about ""You and Me"" (Bobby Bearhug: Oh boy...)
F-R-O-W-N (CraftyCorn: That's not so nice...)
Not your friend, and won't pretend! (CatNap: Heheh!!)
F-R-O-W-N (Kickin'Chicken: Not cool!)
We're unhappy till the end!

Frown!
Frown Everyday, no other way
To get some peace and quiet
I don't buy it!
Hate!
All of your happy games, and smiley ways
We don't enjoy it!
Why destroy it??

Floppy wants to sleep, and Icky won't eat
And Groddy hates you, Dogpressed is blue
Ignore that Wimpin Chicken' and Boring UniqueCorn
Dumb Dumbba Dumbbaphant, not much more...

Hey- what you mean not much more? 
Y-you cant lie about that 
Infront of the Smiling Critters?! 
Its a song for all of us, including me???
 Cmon, dont leave me out guys! 

Don't you lie
It's Catfeine, 
You're fine!
You're happy, 
Stay with me!
The caffeine-

LYRICS
Me more me qaf me more
Ma bere jeten malore
O te dua o s'te dua
Kshu me merzit ti mua.

Me thuaj dy fjale te embla
Tepelena s'duron dengla
Me lodhen nazet e tua
Kshu me merzit ti mua.

Te dua qene te dua
afrohu nje here tek mua
Te dua qene te dua
Betohem per syte e tua
Aaaaa kshu me merzit mua.

REFRENI
Te marrte lumi 
lume edhe perrua
Kur s'me hedh syte moj
Kshu me merzit mua.

Jeten ti moj ma ke nxirre
Nuk me the nje fjale te mire
Here do molle e here do ftua
Kshu me merzit ti mua.

Se ma thone dy syte e tu
Ndaj akoma jam ketu
Ah kjo zemer mu merua
Kshu me merzit ti mua.

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?!

Oʻylab qolaman, oʻtkinchi olam,
Mol-dunyoga buncha oʻch bu odam?
Choʻntak boʻsh boʻlsa bosma qadam,
Mensimasdan qarar koʻz qiridan.

Sezmay qolaman, aldaydi odam,
Qoʻrqmaydi, harom non yer hiyladan.
Maqsad — sotish, hatto sotuvda badan,
Tavba qil, qoʻrq olov taftidan.

Unutma, ey inson, bu — foniy dunyo,
Boʻlma razil, tushdamassan, bu — roʻyo.
Oʻylaysan hammasi yaxshidek goʻyo,
Sen sabab yo haq, yo nohaq bu dunyo.

Tuzilgan shunaqa “qora dastur”,
Piyodasan, yoʻqmi moshina — ozgina past tur.
Boy kasal boʻlsa, doʻxtirlar hammasi gʻamxoʻr,
Kambagʻalning joni ogʻrisa, “Navbatda jim tur!”

Boʻlsa boldi bitta yangi iPhone,
Oʻtdi vaqt maqsadsiz, doim birga shayton.
Qora Gentra, 3-4 soʻm pul, ol senga maydon,
Tulki, boʻri, ilon — oʻzi shularmi hayvon? 

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?! (2x)

Tan olaman, koʻp narsa bogʻliq pulga,
Suzmayman, mayli, qarshi oqimga.
Kechib ketdi bir chaqa deb, ogʻir botdi dilga,
Bor bogʻliq narsalar — pulgamas, koʻngilga. 

Aytaman bitta gapni oʻsha boy zoʻrlarga,
Savol-javob bitta joyda, sen va pulga zorlarga.
Sevgandim — berishmadi, doʻstman qora tunlarga,
Yor-yor bilan ketdi qasri borlarga.

Oʻylab qolaman, oʻtkinchi olam,
Mol-dunyoga buncha oʻch bu odam?
Choʻntak boʻsh boʻlsa bosma qadam,
Mensimasdan qarar koʻz qiridan.

Dunyo shunchalar qimmatmi?
Shu pulsiz zulmatmi?
Boylik — eng ulugʻ ne’matmi?
Yoʻqmi inson qiymati?!

Letra/Lyrics: 
Jajaja
Maluma, ba-ba-baby

[Pre-Coro]
Te vi en la disco perreando con otro
Pero pusieron el disco que era de nosotros
Me miraste a los ojos, te reíste
Ya con eso todo me dijiste
Pensaba que me superaste porque no volviste

[Coro]
Al parecer la baby no me olvidó, sigue pendiente
Quiere ignorarme, pero es que la tensión se ve, se siente
Si le pregunta' que si ya me olvidó y dice que sí, te miente
No es un secreto que entre ella y yo quedaron cosas pendiente'
Al parecer la baby no me olvidó, sigue pendiente
Quiere ignorarme, pero es que la tensión se ve, se siente
Si le pregunta' que si ya me olvidó y dice que sí, te miente
No es un secreto que entre ella y yo quedaron cosas pendientes

Quedaron cosas pendiente'
Una noche caliente, una cena romántica (Sí)
¿Por qué me ves diferente?
Delante 'e la gente te hace' la antipática (Ah)
Quieres quedar como la buena, mami
Tú sabe' que eso sigue siendo pa' mí
Mirando fotos, en las tuya' caí
Y no te niego, cariñito me di (Me di)
No sé por qué lo intentaste con el siguiente
Si para superarme no está preparada
La huella que te dejé sigue permanente
Como tatuaje, eso ya no lo borra nada
¿Será que te hago falta, bebé?
Que él no te llena' con na'
Que me olvidaste juré

Y al parecer la baby no me olvidó, sigue pendiente
Quiere ignorarme, pero es que la tensión se ve, se siente
Si le pregunta' que si ya me olvidó y dice que sí, te miente
No es un secreto que entre ella y yo quedaron cosas pendientes
Jaja
Alright, alright, alright, alright
Maluma, ba-ba-baby, jaja
+PRETTY +DIRTY
Mamacita, I know you miss me, jaja
Mua

Artist : Justy Aldrin, Wizz Baker, Toton Caribo

Lyrics : 
HILANG  

Ada yang hilang dan takkan kembali
Namun waktu memaksamu trus jalani
Lewati kerasnya hari penuh kerikil duri
Kawan , ingatlah kau tak sendiri

Bila kau berlari dan kakimu letih
Berhenti sejenak akan ku temani
Walau dunia tak peduli dan cinta tak kau temui 
Kawan , kami ada disini

Hilang hanya sebentar
Sudahi sedihmu kawan …..
Kelak kau kan percaya
Cinta kan sembuhkan luka 

Relakan apa yang pergi
Yakinkan pasti kembali
Lebih dari yang kau sadari


Kadang muncul nya bencana 
tanpa adanya rencana  
tangan di lipat 
Dan lutut berteguk ke tanah
semesta berpihak entah keemana ?

Kadang kau bimbang dan terus  bertanya  
Tak seimbang hidup ku dengan tetangga 
walau di gubuk tak sebanding mreka  
Yg tinggal 
rumah ber tangga 



Ada sebab apa penyebab 
Tuhan kenapa terjadi ledak?   Aer di klilingi api 
Dermaga menangis kuat tuk hadapi 

Langit cerah asap yg gelap 
Angin membius jiwa terlelap 
KAMI PERCAYA  engkau lah kiblat 
kebaikan mu selalu tingalkan jejak


Kadang kau sesali semua yang terjadi
Lupakan sejenak , tetap kau syukuri
Ada yang datang dan pergi janganlah kau bersedih
Di depan masih ada matahari


Kadang terjatuh
Kadang kau rapuh
Jangan ragu
Aku ada untukmu

Hilang hanya sebentar
Sudahi sedihmu kawan …..
Kelak kau kan percaya
Cinta kan sembuhkan luka 

Relakan apa yang pergi
Yakinkan pasti kembali
Lebih dari yang kau sadari

Lyrics | الكلمات

بتطلع عنفسيتي بتعرف فيني هم
وين بروح بحالي ارضي كلها سم
الصبر والقوة دافع حقن دم
زرعت ورد لناس ما بتعرف تشم

صفنت الشمعة ونزلت دمعة
بوقت الكل كسرني
مسحت الدمعة لأطفي الشمعة
القوة بذاتها رادتني
قلبي ياخدني ع طريقك
كلمة ب شِعري تشعل حريقك
عبوابك واقف حتى صيدك
حالف تتكوني من نصيبي

خيَّال خيَّال .. خيَّال خيَّال
رح تتحامي بظهر رجال
وانا من الباب والله ترحال 
فرس اصيلة وبدها خيال
و مخدرة هالبال
اصبر مابقدر من هالجمال
طالب ايدك انا بالحلال ..

وانا تشهدلي الأرض 
عدوي كان مرافقني فرض
حابس جوا قلبي الجراح
نشلتو وصار نقطة بالنرد

المعركة يلي بتفوت فيا .. 
يا بتنهيك ! يا بتنهيا !!

وأنا رح انهيا ..! حارقها باللي فيا ..!
مدمر بُكرة أبيها ..! جرح قلبي مخزن اذية ..!

وأنا رح انهيا ..! حارقها باللي فيا ..!
مدمر بُكرة أبيها ..! بنت قلبي هايا البنية ..!

بس من بعد فترة الضعف
رجعت خيال وايدي بالألف
تعد الكسرة وحدة وحدة وعالرف
كل عدة كانت ايدا والكف 
وتقلي على جرحي اصحى
والوجع صابني وقت الفرحة
كل كسرة تهدني بجبرها
وانا نفسي الله عاززها 

خيال .. خيال .. عشت عمري خيال
كاسر جناح طيري .. يضعف عندي مافي مجال !

خيال .. خيال .. عشت عمري خيال
لا ما رح شوفا لغيري .. وهيه بقلبي والله !",Odai - عدي,"أغاني عربية, أغاني عربية ٢٠٢٤, أغاني راب عربية ٢٠٢٤, new music, راب عربي, odai music, odai 2024, odai, عدي, عودي, oday, udai, جديد عدي, اجدد اغاني عدي, احدث اغاني عدي, عدي 2024, odai new, odai new song, Khyial, kyal, khyial, odai khyial, odai khyial 2024, خيال, وانا رح انهيا, حارقها باللي فيها, وانا تشهدلي الارض, المعركة يلي بتفوت فيها يا بتنهيك يا بتنهيا, فرس اصيلة, بوب, زرعت ورد لناس ما بتعرف تشم, كليب خيال",10,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music,2024-11-02T13:00:06Z,PT3M17S,5898345,5190,False,No Caption,No Location
